    "Develop a classification model that can distinguish which of two subreddits, (r/diet or r/exercise), a particular post belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diet and exercise are both essential for optimal health. And people often incorporate diet (for the purpose of living a healthy life) with exercise in their daily lives. We also often associate the word diet with unpleasant weight-loss regimen?  For example, consider the use of the term \"diet\" in marketing food products—it usually describes foods low in calories, such as diet soda.But there is another meaning of this word. Diet can also refer to the food and drink a person consumes daily and the mental and physical circumstances connected to eating. Nutrition involves more than simply eating a “good” diet—it is about nourishment on every level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise and diet is associated with weight loss, losing weight, reduce fat, burn calorie(food or type of exercises). There are posts that are diet related are posted in r/exercise and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the data scientist on the team, I have been assigned the task of building a classificiation model that can accurately classify posts from each subreddit so that r/diet and r/exercise can be free of unrelated posts so that the forum can continue to offer accurate content. "
