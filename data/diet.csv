diet,"For those of you that do not know, a fruitarian diet consists of 50% raw fruit, sometimes even more, as high as 75%!!!!!! Fruitarians should consider becoming a normal vegan because their current diet is completely useless.

A lot of people love to spread misinformation and say that the fruitarian diet is amazing for health. No, it is not, it is terrible, there is nothing good about this diet, it is as bad, if not worse than the standard American diet! Let's take a look at common issues with the fruit diet. This post does not even cover all of the problems, by the way, and a vegan diet still requires a lot of research to be done safely.

1) Iron. Iron is an essential micro nutrient that is, in a vegan diet, typically found in dark green vegetables (cooked spinach is one of the best sources), chia seeds (a great source when you consider there is the secondary benefit of omega 3), whole grain cereals that have been fortified, beans and legumes. As you can see, none of these things are a fruit, and if you are a women, there is almost no chance you can get enough iron on a fruitarian diet.

2) Zinc. This mineral is not really something you will typically see in fruits. Legumes, nuts, seeds, oats and tofu and examples of great sources, yet none of these are fruits. And before you mention avocadoes, note that it is nutritionally closer to a vegetable than to a fruit.

3) Calcium. This essential mineral is also another case of something that you will almost never find in fruits. Dark green vegetables, beans, chia seeds and a lot of other fruits all contain more calcium that any fruit could ever dream of.

4) Proteins. This macronutrient is very rare in fruits, but even if it is present, it will not be bioavailable: the body needs some amino acids to digest them, which would not be a problem with a standard vegan diet if you pair your foods carefully. You might start losing weight, but a lot of it will be muscle, not fat, for this reason. Your protein intake is going to be very limited.

5) Vitamin D. Fruits do not contain it at all, so during winter you will have very little vitamin D.

6) Essential fats. None of them can be found in fruits. You will need to get omega 3 and 6 elsewhere. Because so much of your diet is fruits, you barely get any healthy fat. 

7) You will get way too many carbohydrates. The sugar found in fruits typically goes to the liver, which is fine when they are eaten as part of a balanced meal plan (25-30% of your diet would be fruits), which is not the case here, there is a huge amount of sugar and the liver &amp; pancreas will suffer a lot. 

8) Vitamin B12. Fruits are not fortified with it, and you already have so many other nutrients to worry about, and now on top of that you need to eat fortified foods?

""But can't I just supplement everything?"" No, not really. The human body is very complex and the science of nutrition is not really understood that well, and supplements fail to recreate the chemistry in foods that our body is used to digest. Taking one supplement will often block the absorption of another nutrient, for example calcium supplements are harmful to the absorption of iron. Another example is that a vitamin C pill does not reduce the risk of cancer while eating vitamin C rich foods like kiwi does, which shows how important the interactions of the elements in foods that we do not understand are. Also, there are cases in which people simply cannot absorb supplements properly due to health issues. Overall, having your vitamins and minerals from food is just so much better.

""But since only 50%-75% of the diet is fruits, I can eat other things and avoid the deficiencies you described."" Not really, you have a lot of things to worry about, so if you stick to a true frutarian diet, you will almost certainly be able to get all of the needed nutrients with the little food you have left that is not fruits. Afterall, fruits are pretty much never the solution to any of the lacking nutrients in a vegan diet. Neither iron, zinc, calcium, proteins, essential fats, vitamin b12, vitamin D, will be found in fruits. 

Think about it this way. A typical vegan diet typically only has a moderate amount of fruit servings, yet most vegans fail to keep it long term without deficiencies, and the majority of their diet (fortified foods, dark greens, legumes) contains quite a bit of the nutrients that are commonly lacking, so if the backbone of your diet a plant type that has none of the commonly needed nutrients in a vegan diet, I believe you will likely run into trouble.",Debunking the fruitarian diet,1659567365

I'm now thinking of trying to remove those oatmeal bars, despite oatmeal being considered a ""high fiber food"" that prevents constipation. I have a couple of reasons why (and I really want to know if these assumptions are correct)...

1. I generally use the bathroom every morning when I wake up
2. I would assume that means that the beginning of my BM consists of the first things I've eaten and that the ending of my BM consists of things I've eaten later. 
3. I eat the oatmeal bars first thing in the morning.
4.  I'm experiencing problems only in the very beginning of my BM

Therefor the oatmeal bars would be the problem, right? Is point 2 correct?

I was wondering if anyone has any healthy recipes that’s good for your heart/blood pressure? My dad is an older man with obesity, a history of heart issues and other health conditions that I don’t want to get into. I’ve been wanting to try to help him eat better at least when he’s home.

diet,"Because my partner has unique food habits, I sometimes worry if he hits all nutrient targets (or if there's something he's missing).

He has a great system for someone with IBS and mental health related lack of energy. He cooks one big pot that lasts him around 6 meals. It's one third grain, one third legumes and one third vegetables/other. For variety, he circles through ALL types of grains and beans/lentils that you can possibly find. His vegetable/other selection is limited to canned or sporadic fresh produce, which is usually limited to: carrots, Sauerkraut, cabbage, salad, potatoes. He snacks on nuts sometimes and eats either apples, pears or berries daily. But 90% of the time he eats 2-3 apples a day. Supplements are B12, D, sometimes Calcium.

The reason I'm sometimes worried is because it's very fixed. It's mostly grains, legumes, apples. The ""vegetable"" sections falls short and only really includes these five things I listed. Bell pepper, kale, aubergine, zucchini, bananas, avocadoes, sweet potatoe, etc. etc. rarely come canned and are therefore selected against in his diet.","Is my partners diet balanced?

So I’m following a diet, and I’ve lost all motivation and willpower for continuing the diet. I started it last year at 128, had lost 24kg to 104kg and then gained back 5 kgs to my current of 109.

I’ve been dieting for a couple months, eating mainly high-protein, low carb, with good mix of veggies.

I joined this subreddit (and discord) because I'm responsible for putting dinner on the table for my family every night and it's becoming quite a puzzle to make sure everyone's individual needs are met without having to cook 5 different dishes. I hope to find some guidance here. Let me introduce my family to you;

Me (29f): SAHM &amp; chronic pain patient. I'm at the low end of a healthy weight so losing some isn't really an option, but a keto diet would be beneficial to me in terms of pain management. 

K (40m): he's at the high end of a healthy weight. He tried keto 2 years ago, lost weight really easily and then stopped to focus on his mental health and gained more than he'd lost in the first place.

N (29f): on the verge of being underweight, should gain some. 

S (9m): skinny, but not underweight. 

L (6f): underweight and suffering from encopresis, she really needs a high-fiber diet. 

D is just 7 weeks old, so there's nothing but formula on the menu for him. At least that's easily decided :)

My main question is; to keto or not to keto? I've seen what the diet can do both in terms of weight loss and pain management and I'm really considering putting the entire family on the keto diet. However, I don't know if that's such a good idea for small children, or for people who really can't afford to lose weight in the process? Are there other diets that would suit our family better?

So I have a FitBit, and I have been wearing it everyday all day and I’m curious if I’m in a decent deficit calorie wise. On average, I lift weights hard for 60-75 minutes per day, run or some form of cardio for 60 minutes a day, walk my dog, jump rope for 30 minutes a day, and I’m moving around all day. I average 20,000+ steps a day which includes my 4-7 mile run. According to FitBit my average daily calorie burn is around 4,300-4,500. I’m 41, 6’ .50” tall, and I weigh 194-196. Current BF is around 14%. My daily calorie goal is 2,796 and my macros around 65-85g of fat, 275-300g of carbs, and 220-250g of protein per day. I’ve set my calories at 2,796 but some days I may eat closer to 3,000. I know FitBit can be off, so do you think I’m safe by allowing a 1,000 calories swing in burn. In other words if it says I burned 4,500 then I act as if I burned 3,500 and eat a minimum of 500 calories below that. Or do you think FitBit is off by even more.

I was gonna attempt yuca and cassava, but uh...just looking those up kinda scared me since apparently they have cyanide in them. Cassava more than yuca. From what I researched cassava has to be soaked and washed waaay longer than yuca.

This screenshot is of one full day eating pretty much as best as I can right now (best that I feel comfortable and satisfied with currently). Like 3 full cooked meals, every single ingredient that entered my body. Everything weighed and properly added to the app. So I want to understand the nutrients more......

How am I doing with nutrients so far from what you can see for my body? What do I need more of? How can I reduce sodium.... I've literally been over the sodium recommendation on the app every single day since I downloaded it I think. I feel like its impossible to lower my sodium. I am eating regular foods that everyone eats, I dont know why its always so much sodium... Is it okay that my carbs are a bit low? Is my fat too high? Is the protein good enough? I don't know how I can even get more protein. I am eating protein every meal (eggs breakfast, flank steak lunch, ground beef dinner). What you see in this screenshot is 2000 cals~.

diet,"Hey all.

I'm underweight, always has been, but did gain quite a bit of weight when I started to excercise in my early 20's, and started to eat more as well. For awhile I felt GREAT.

Due to things and stuff, I lost mh excercise routine and started eating less naturally again. I've tried so many times to get back into excercise of the last few years (28 years old at the moment) but I awalys, fail, partly because I'm an so damn tired, which probably is due to the fact that I don't eat as much. A few problems is that I am a very picky eater (always has been, getting better but there's still so many things I just can't eat, and I hate it), I have a naturally low appetite I guess (I don't snack much during workdays as I'm busy doing stuff, only if I'm doing nothing I want to snack), and I get full quickly so IF I snack I'll probably eat less when I have a main meal... I tried calorie counting for like a week a couple of years ago but stopped as it was too time consuming, but I remember it definitely wasn't enough for weight gain). 

I have been thinking about food replacement drinks, but most are advertised as weight loss, like ""this will fill you up but is only 100 calories"" or w/e which is obviously the opposite of what I want. Is there similar products that are not as filling? I've seen protein companies do ""weight gain"" blends but the usually contain whey which I (suprise suprise) don't like. Only protein drink I can stomach is Clear Whey and honestly even that is a struggle. But at the same time, I can't eat anything ""dry"", even when eating normal meals I need to drink between every bite essentially (which also means I fill up more quickly). 

So, tldr, how to gain weight in a healthy way when you don't want to eat for like a multitude of reasons? I'd love to speak to a mental health professional or diatrician about this ofc, but that's not possible atleast in the short run, maybe in a few years if I'm lucky.

I obviously know there's more to it than sugar, and I'm keen to hear about those things... but sugar seems to be the most trustable signal of good vs bad food bc everyone agrees it's bad, whereas I hear strong-seeming arguments on both sides of most other nutrition debates.

diet,"So since beginning of this year I have been bulking and i have gained some weight (around 8kg). Well around may everything changed. I became sick (normal cold/fever. Normal stuff) for around a week. Ever since that week my appetite has been completely shit.

Before this week i usually ate around 2.8k calories everyday and sometimes around 3-4k calories. Now i struggle to eat a 6inch subway sandwich and i feel very tired due to me training alot but not managing to eat enough food to recover. When eating usually what happens is

1. I feel hungry and like 1-5 bites later i feel full 2. I eat like normally and around halfway through my meal i get super full all off a sudden.

When getting full if i try to eat more I'm always really close to puking. There is a lot more i experienced like always feeling bloated.

For example I just went shopping and walked 5k steps and says it burned 242 cals, but I'm already doing a 300~ cal deficit just on diet alone. So if I dont eat an extra 242 cals from that walking does that mean I'm at 542 cal deficit? What if I do like 15k steps, then my deficit would be well over 500?

diet,"I'm 25 years old, female, about 4'11"", 97lb but my diet is not great. The main issue is I eat too much fast food. I usually eat fast food or other unhealthy meals (e.g. chicken schnitzel sandwich) 2 - 3 times per week.

When I was a kid, my parents didn't really cook or feed me properly, so I ended up eating a lot of simple things that a kid can make (toast, noodles, cereal, microwaved chicken nuggets etc) so I grew up nutrient deficient. As a result, I'm also a picky eater because I just didn't have exposure to many different foods.

However I've been working on it and have been trying new foods, especially vegetables.

Recently I started getting HelloFresh every few weeks, mostly to try new foods and get inspiration for different meals.

It helped for a while, although I was still eating fast food at least once a week.

I think the main problems are:

* Cravings; \*especially\* if I let myself get too hungry and feel too weak to cook something or the craving for something salty/sugary is too strong. It can be hard to avoid going without food at times. Sometimes I'm too wrapped up in work before I realise I'm hungry.
* Accessibility and ease; it's just easy for me to go to the drive through or even walk down stairs to a cafe (I live in the city) and order something versus cooking something.
   * Even when I have a meal prepped and ready to heat up, I just have strong cravings to get fast food.

The worst part is, I don't even like most of the fast food that I eat. It tastes ok, but it makes me feel fat, gross, sick. I know it's not good for me. But I struggle with cravings and give in too much. I'm basically addicted to it. I'm concerned about my health, especially heart health. I exercise regularly, and obviously I'm not even close to being overweight, but I'm afraid I'm on the path there and I'm struggling to control my cravings.

As I know to gain weight you need to have higher calories in than calories you burn, in order to gain MUSCLE (not just any kind of weight) you need to eat protein - 2 g per kg of bodymass (some say 1.5 is enough).

diet,The only reason keto works is because you're  limited to filling foods. example if you ate 1000 calories in chips vs 1000 calories in ground beef what will keep you full all day yup the ground beef.  Why because its dense and has lots of fats and protein keeping you full lessening the desire to eat and guess what ground beef is keto. But the thing is if you eat 3 pounds of it wanna know what's gonna happen you're gonna gain weight the only reason keto works is because the majority of foods you eat are satiating and will keep you full till your next real meal that includes portion control that's why you lose weight not because carbs=evil.

Why not give everything for free? Why not tell people what to do, and if they need help with implementing the technique, then they can buy a service.

 I'm a coach, and I see this every day. Women in their 40s seek help, and there's always a guru to sell them a new weight loss pill, a weight loss program, etc. I think this is just manipulative.

diet," 

All  of the calorie information on my foods assumes they're uncooked. We  know that cooking food increases the calorie value of foods, but my  research online has not pointed to any reliable way of determining \*how  much\* more.

\*I only cook it by heating it up in a pan, following a basic recipe, without adding anything else. It's just heat that I add, which science has shown unlocks calories because it makes the digestion easier for the body\*

My salad: Baby spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, garlic, some olive oil.

I  could simply count up the calories in my servings and leave it at that,  but that would not be an accurate recording of my calorie intake. I  cook all the above ingredients.

Is there a reliable way of determining how the calories are different than the uncooked listed values?

call me childish or whatever but i am a picky eater for quite a few different varietes of food and its difficult for me, i just started going to the gym and i am trying to start to eat healthier and i am wondering if people have tips to help with this for someone who doesnt eat a lot of vegatables or salad and how to try new foods and cope with trying it or however i can explain it in a way that makes sense. I love fruit and will eat many different fruits but i know vegatables are more important, i really only like cucumbers because they dont have a taste really and potatos if that counts in any form not just unhealthy and deepfried not that potatos are very healthy to begin with. I might like some other vegatables but i cant think of anything else that counts as vegatables right now that i eat so id have to think about it more. So far before ive tried carrots and i find them disgusting and vile i cant eat them without gagging they dont taste that bad i dont think really but my body rejects it. Is there any types of vegatables that dont have much taste or that taste not bitter and maybe somewhat sweet and dont have any smell or not a noticable smell?

Also if anyone knows is it okay to still drink diet pop (soda) sometimes i also am giving up on my slight addiction to diet soda since its not good but is it okay to drink sometimes like not even everyday just once and a while? Same with zero sugar types of foods like no sugar jello is it bad to eat if i am only eating like one a day as a snack because i am diebetic and i eat those for snacks sometimes because of no carbs. The main thing i hear about things with sweetner is that they mess with your matabolism and generally arent good for you still so i am asking for anyone who has an opinion on it if they could help me out with this too.

Another thing is that i am still only 15 years old and growing so i dont want to undereat trying to do a calorie deficit and limit my growth. I went on tdee calculator and searched my maintence calories whilst doing 4 days a week at the gym and daily exercise at home the days i dont go to the gym. It says my maintence is 2,577 calories a day so if i eat about 1800-2000 calories a day with this exercise routine will that make me loose weight while i build muscle in the gym?

but here’s the thing. ever since i started repairing my lifestyle (specifically with food) that changed. FAST. and i don’t understand it and i can’t seem to get used to it. so, originally, i had a calorie deficit i wanted to follow, but i found i had to keep increasing it. not because of cravings, not because of being guilty and cheating my diet, but because I am SO UNBELIEVABLY HUNGRY! And i know the lecture i’m gonna get; “Eat more fats and protein!” but for the love of god i really have been eating plenty of it! I’ve had to have multiple protein bars, 2 eggs, some steak and even nearly half a bag of pistachios (throughout the day) and after every single one of those i was STILL hungry! and that doesn’t even include the rest of the meals today. 

I just don’t know what to do! Should i be eating when i’m hungry or not?!? This totally ruined my plan to start a healthy calorie deficit! I know that having a fast metabolism means you can essentially eat more food without gaining weight because of the calorie oxygen and energy process and whatever, but another part of me feels deep guilt for eating that much, EVEN though I know the stuff i’m eating is healthy. and, a third part of me says this will all backfire and either a. i will physically not be able to lose any weight without being extremely hungry all the time, or B. i’ll end up gaining all of the past few days worth of food in very high numbers under the impression that my fast metabolism will “take care of it.” It doesn’t help that if i “don’t eat” i immediately start getting symptoms of nutrient deficiency i. e. extreme tiredness, immediately and sort of severely lightheaded upon sitting or standing (though i have always been subject to something called POTS,) hard time focusing , headaches, etc. (sounds worse on paper , but really it’s not that severe or affects me too a concerning point)

i know by reading this you are probably all under the influence that i have some kinda crazy eating disorder that i’m sugarcoating, but have faith in me; i don’t ! 

but in conclusion, i’m feeling all sorts of things. anger, mostly, since the control i wanted to have on my body was immediately revoked once again, but also hunger…

tldr: wanting to lose weight, started to eat healthy, exercise, and begin a calorie deficit when suddenly my metabolism decided to be faster than the wild west to the point where i can’t go 5 minutes without eating despite heavy intake on things like protein and fats to keep myself filled; thus ruining the whole point of my calorie deficit. got to a point where I faced some starvation symptoms just from 20-30 minutes withdrawal of food. Not sure where to go from here— continue eating as much food as my body is telling me (which by the way is a HUGE amount of food, legit destroyed the fridge in just a few days and still
hungry) whilst worried that i won’t achieve weight loss, or try to cut back on the food and achieve a calorie deficit despite my extreme appetite.

or maybe just a trip to my doctor.

I’m quite health focused and noticed there are a lot of studies which suggest that adults who were not breastfed have increased risk of illness such as autoimmunity, cardiovascular etc throughout life.

As health is one of the things I’m very grateful for and value in myself when I found out I wasn’t breastfed (my mum said she just didn’t want to) I felt secretly disappointed since

Just wanted opinions I guess do you think that type of infant milk impacts quite a lot of adult health or are the studies just talking about a slight effect?

Also does it mean that everyone who received no human milk would have been healthier adults if they had?

In march I got COVID and was sick at the sight of myself despite all my hard work I was still podgy and at 5ft 8 and 80kgs I looked like crap. I enlisted a personal trainer and after 3 months I managed to get down to 76kgs and around 18 to 19% body fat. I did this on:
Daily:
2206kcal a day
190g protein
154g carbs*
91g fat
1 cheat meal a week.

This worked for about 2 months and now I've hir a plateau for the last 4, constantly bouncing between 76 and 78kgs and 18 to 20% body fat with no improvement.

I have looked to reduce my macros again to sub 2000kcal maybe 1800 to 1900.

A lot of diets say cut out carbs and just fats but how tf do I eat that many calories with no carbs and just protein??? 190g a day is already way too much for my weight and height. I've seen one diet suggesting 254g protein a day? Thats well over 2 per kg in body weight and surely dangerous?

I've also seen people say just lift heaver hut I'm naturally very weak for a guy. My 1rpm after 3 months of deadlifting with a personal trainer is still only 120-125 and bench around 80kg 1rpm.

I do 5 on 2 off at the gym 3 days lifting and cardio  the other 2 cardio or lifting. The weight lifting is a 4 days split of chest, back, legs and shoulders (main lifts being bench, deadlift, squat and military)

I wanted banana chips during my shopping trip, the kind that are crunchy and sweet- the kind you'd find in trail mix.  Without paying attention I grabbed Green Banana Chips... they claim to be sliced green bananas, but they're absolutely potato chips.  There is zero difference in taste. 

So I felt stupid after realizing what I actually bought,  but ate a mini bag anyway.  I looked at the nutritional value afterwards,  and holy shit... 450 calories... 52 carbs... 21 g of fat and 11 saturated... 500 MG of sodium... 2g of protein. 

A mama burger at a&amp;w is 400 cal (-50),  19 g of fat ( -2) and 7 saturated (-4), 38 carbs (-14), 850 MG of sodium (+350), 20 g of protein (+18).

Just really took me aback.  I'm new to this diet thing,  but just amazed that even one of these mini bags is much worse than a damn burger,  and if I ate two bags which would basically weigh the same as the burger, it's totally a write off  for any work I do at the gym.

It's to the point that if I  eat out for dinner (with no alcohol), I often feel unsafe to drive home  afterwards.

This Monday I started with a diet to get more into shape. Let me start with the context. I'm 28 years old, 1.65cm and weighed 76 kg on Sunday which I took as my starting point. I don't wanna lose a lot but I really want to get back under the 70 kg maybe a little more.
I did a few of those online tests to check how many calories I should consume to lose weight and they all averaged around 1850 kcal per day split into 3 to 4 meals a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack somewhere in between).

Since then I've been tracking my meals quite precisely. I decided to just weigh myself everyday to check when things would start kicking in but noticed the following. I weight myself in the morning before breakfast.

Sunday: 76
Monday: 75.1
Tuesday: 74.7
Wednesday: 74.5
Thursday: 73.9

This shocked me a bit? Losing 2 kilos in 4 days does not sound entirely healthy? But I'm not overly sure!
I have never been on a diet before. I do notice that what I eat now is Way less then how I used to eat before I started. I've also added more regular exercise to my daily schedule.

diet,"Two questions in one! I was researching for a while and learned about brown rice. I got some from dollar tree once (bad idea) and didn't taste that great. Recently was researching and found the healthiest brown rice according to google, Lundberg Family Farms long grain brown rice.

Not sure if that's true or not. 😅 Since doing more research about rice I see articles and health sites saying that it contains arsenic. Some I saw said it had very low levels and you could wash it to get rid of it. Honestly just seeing all of that made me not want to consume rice at all anymore. I'm not sure what to believe.

The other question was what can I do to incorporate veggies in my diet? 

I made a post before about veggies and fruit, and how I was originally going to make smoothies whenever I could make the money to buy the blender I wanted.

Then I saw peeps saying blending isn't such a great idea, for some reasons. One being about fruit turning into ""free sugars"" or something, like refined sugars you see in desserts and all that. Idk bruh. 

The reason why I had that idea was because I was weaned on really processed and bad food since I was a kid. So I'm like... literally incapable of enjoying fresh real healthy veggies and fruit.

I hate the pulp. I hate the texture. Just yesterday I attempted to consume a Navel Orange, since I researched about them yesterday and mistook them for being regular oranges. They're apparently sweeter.

Attempted to bite into it and...I couldn't even get the flesh off 😂 but I tasted the juice and it was nice! Not super sweet like desserts which I'm pretty sure is how it's supposed to be, but not tangy or sour like a regular orange. All I got everytime I bit into it was the juice not the pulp anyway. Still, progress. I guess?


I'm not really sure how to incorporate any of that into my diet...if I can somehow incorporate some veggies into my diet that I actually ENJOY and if I leave fruits for smoothies, would that be good enough? Idk what to do here.

I do use fruits in brines and a bunch of herbs like oregano, thyme, basil, all that great stuff. I love dried herbs! So it's not like I don't get any sort of greens but obviously, that is not enough. 😅 The only thing I bought recently is some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to put into my chicken taco meat whenever I make that. Again, doesn't really feel like enough..or if that's even healthy compared to fresh peppers.

diet,"Hi everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

first post here. I am asking for advice for my girlfriend actually. She is 28 and has gained weight in the last 10 years or so to the point she is around 40lbs heavier than she should. She has never been much active but when a young girl used to bike and walk a lot and has gained a lot of muscle, compared to the overall weight, for her age. She has quite large legs but weak arms. To correct all this, she has been followed by a dietician in the last 2 years but with meager results.

At the beginning of this year she asked the dietician for a plan that would allow here to lose at least half the amount she has before our summer vacation in September. The dietician was positive this was perfectly doable and prepared a diet of about 1750kcal for a TDEE of 1680kcal. She gave her some light exercising to do 3 days a week.

The issue is, due to covid and other health issues, neither me nor her have been exercising regularly in the past 3-4 months. Some weeks we do as planned, other weeks we completely skip. We don't go to the gym but train at home. My gf has stomach issues that we need to investigate about that cause her to switch some dishes every other day because otherwise the acidity is unbearable. She is going to get tested this month about this.

So, despite not following religiously the diet nor exercising much, she has lost about 3.5lbs of fat while gaining 4.5lbs of muscle since February.  She is at the same point as she was, more or less, months ago but with less fat and more muscle.

The dietician doesn't understand how she could have gained muscle while eating barely the TDEE and being incostant with exercising. She suspects myostatin-induced muscle hypertrophy. We don't know yet for certain though.

My question is: if it were true, what could my gf do to steadily lose fat? She doesn't care about muscles nor want to join a gym and is actually scared more regular exercising would only make her bulk more rather than slimming down. Anybody has any suggestion or a similar case?

So i've been dealing with headaches for the last few weeks, like non-stop really bad ones and i got one going right now. pretty concerned and generally uncomfortable. for reasons i'd rather not go into I can't see a doctor, So i'm kinda stuck figuring this out myself, but it's probably fine or something

A few months ago I had a blood test and i came up pretty short on potassium (within 15% iirc). So I was looking at what i've been eating and I realized there's barely any potassium, like the only thing with noticeable potassium i typically eat is milk, and maybe this is a coincidence but the headaches started when I stopped drinking milk. (Prior to this i'd drink like 4 cups a day or something)

iirc the headaches started about 3 days after I stopped drinking that much milk actually

Aside from the headaches I i think i've also been having digestion issues? like june was the first time i've ever had trouble digesting a burger patty, or something like that anyway. I was down for a day or two because of it. Had a patty just recently and it went down fine tho even with the headaches still going so i'm really not sure

but am I totally on the wrong track with my potassium theory? i dont think anyone meets the daily potassium requirements so i find it hard to believe no one else would be having these same problems if it ere a potassium thing.

160 lbs in months following surgery
158 2 weeks ago (first change)
152 lbs yesterday (sudden change)

I am surprised by how much weight I've lost in this last week. I've been monitoring what I eat for months now, avoiding processed and sugary foods and prioritizing fats and proteins and veggies. After my gall bladder was removed, I went kind of crazy on foods I had to avoid previously, so I was trying to undue that weight gain.

Weight loss was neglible or low. Suddenly, this week it seems I'm losing a pound a day. I haven't changed anything that I can tell. Actually, my activity level has dropped from 1-3 activities a week to 0 after I returned from a vacation and lost the rhythm. I'm wondering if there is a threshold for weight loss that signals something is wrong, like a parasite.

diet," I've been losing weight the past 6 weeks focusing on more protein and less sugars and reached my goal of 65kg. Im an athlete height 171cm age 23 and just an estimation but im at around 6-7% fat.  
As a long distance runner (not professional but serious training 7 days/week ) my weight is still 5-10 kg higher than my co athletes (about same height) in the team but I'm more muscular so maintaining 65 kg is my first goal.

I started about 6 weeks ago at 69kg and from online calculators I found that i need about 1900 calories (without the ones burnt from exercise) to maintain my weight and at 75% (\~1400 cal) to lose 0.5kg per week. Every time I reach 65kg though (over the years and then jumped back at 69kg) I start feeling hungry all the time and cant seem to do the same thing i've been doing the past weeks. My calorie intake is 1400 calories + 500-600 cal depending on the intensity of the workout. My goal this time is to maintain the 65kg and in about a month or so start to aim lower/at a slower rate since ill have adjusted.

Do I just start eating 1900 calories + whatever i burn instead of 1400 or will doing this result in gaining even though its what i should be taking due to the long period of dieting? Do I feel hungry all the time because my fat% is super low now or does it mean that I am doing something wrong with my diet.

Now I've been cutting for close to 5 months with no weight training, went from 103KGS to 91KGs with a 500 calorie deficit from my 2500 maintenance, then started lifting and continued cutting for another 5 months (10 total) and went from 91KGs to 83KGs while maintaining the same amount of deficit from my first 5 months cutting (2000 calories a day was still working).

Ever since I hit 83KGs it started getting tough to lose more weight so I turned my intake down to 1750, I'm losing 0.3-0.5KGs per week. My issue with this is that I'm not feeling the greatest in terms of sleep, hunger, and strength in the gym but I don't mind powering through it as it's not impossible and I still haven't hit an amount of body fat I'm happy with when I look in the mirror. I'm just worried about **diminishing returns at this point because of the prolonged cut.**

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I'm at a detrimentally low amount of calorie intake for me to stop the cut, but it does affect the mental a little bit (nothing I can't power through though). But maybe I should reverse diet and see if it would benefit me more? (183cm Male)

Normally I eat at maintenance of around 2700 calories, however, I'm currently working a manual labour job 9-10 hours a day, 5 days a week, burning in the ballpark of 3500 to 4000 extra calories per day (job is pretty full on), while still doing my 5 weight training sessions per week.

I'm planning to reach my goal by reducing my calorie intake to about 2500 calories, and bumping up my protein to around 180g per day. This would give me a weekly deficit of around 20k calories until I reach my goal body fat.

I would love to hear your opinions and thoughts on whether this is a good, okay, bad, or god awful idea. I've been sticking to 2500 calories for the last 3 days of working so I don't expect my commitment to be a limiting factor, but ideally I would like to reduce muscle mass loss if you think I wouldn't be able to put it back on easily when returning to maintenance.

Because food deriving from animals is a main cause for heart diseases and I am at a very high risk to get another attack or even a stroke I became 99% vegan and food became a very important topic for me. Through all my studies of human food traditions I came to reconsider the reasons we drink milk or eat milk products. 

As I said, I did it myself, I loved cheese and butter, my whole family did and most of them still do, I don’t want to blame anyone for doing it, sometimes I still eat cheese as well. But if you try to think of it without any traditions in mind and try to ignore your habits, then it gets really weird.

Now back to the cows. If you wouldn’t have learned it from childhood, you would think of milk from a cow the same way as milk from a dog. The thought alone would be disgusting. 

And now, try to think of human milk. Imagine at a restaurant they would serve you milk some mother just pumped out of her breasts. Most of you would probably be disgusted to drink that, right?

It feels like the damage has been done and my life span is significantly shorter because of it. I was weaned on processed and just bad food since I was small. I love sugar and refined carbs. I've been craving sugar the whole night. That's what's stressing me out the most.

I should not be this terrified of food.

I can't even enjoy fruits or vegetables. I hate the taste of most of them, and even I think the taste of flavor is not so bad (mainly fruits I've thought this about), what gets me is the flesh. The pulp. I absolutely despise the texture of pulp. It's like I can't win. 

I hope soon I can get this strong blender so I can start making fruit and veggie shakes. It just feels like even if I do start consuming that almost daily, it feels like it's not going to be enough to offset the majority of my diet growing up.

Even today I ate rather healthy. I had some yellow rice with black beans and homemade baked chicken which was always my favorite ""healthy"" dish growing up. Even then that scares me since the rice is refined carbs.

I'm just really not fine and stressed out rn and I honestly don't know where to post this since these other subreddits don't allow you to make posts like this where it's personal.

diet,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm debating if I should go back to eating poultry, specifically chicken and turkey.. I was vegetarian for five years and went back to eating fish couple years ago (so, 5 years vegetarian, 2 years pescatarian). I decided to go back to eating fish to help meet my daily protein intake without supplementing.. Could I have been vegetarian and eat all my daily protein? Yes, but it was so difficult. Plus, from a social perspective it was also soooo hard for people to accommodate my diet, they never knew what i could eat and sometimes was so embarrassing.. so fish was easier, plus i personally didn't have any ethical reasons to not eat fish.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm back to eating fish, I feel like my options are so little still lol.. I live in southern Ontario and my fresh fish options are like.. salmon, trout and tilapia basically. I can eat cod, haddock, shrimp, etc, but they're mostly frozen and smelly. Back when i lived in Brazil, good fish was fresh and straight out of ocean. Now my daily diet is mostly some fish + beyond meat, beyond sausage, impossible burger etc... And these processed meats have so much fat, calories and salt I don't even know if it's healthy. Can I eat more beans? Probably, but who eats fish and beans..? Not appetizing at all.. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm debating going back to eating poultry and I wanted to know if anyone went through what I'm going through. Any advice, tips.. Also thinking about ethical reasons?

I used to be in severe daily pain &amp; wasn’t able to get out of bed or walk. When I strictly follow the diet, I’m a new person. My pain levels are down &amp; I can function normally. I track my macros &amp; make sure that I’m balanced every day. 

When I told my docs I went on the diet, they were actually excited for me! They said it’s the best thing for a person with my condition. This diet can keep my disease at bay and keep it from progressing. But my docs don’t often recommend it because it’s so hard to stick to.

Ugh. I believe it.

But for more than a year I’ve experienced complete stagnation - since my thyroid started to malfunction and obviously I’ve developed some kind of metabolic complex. I have no idea what to do
I’m very active (I cycle to work almost everyday (at least 3 days a week) between March and October - 50 up to 90 km a day (I have varying work locations). I’m also doing 2 strength trainings - rather short, but intense. 
I do try to eat at least BMR + what I get from bicycle computer -10% (I have HR meter and power meter, so those are pretty accurate) - yet I can’t loose a single kilogram for months.

I'm sitting pretty much all day but I do strength training for at least 30 minutes a day 6 days a week with an hour of moderately intense stationary bike cardio on the off day. My goal is to get toned by cutting. Onto my diet qualms.

Prior to today I was eating about 2000 calories a day of 95% whole foods. The extra 5% accounts for my protein shakes and turkey bacon. While this plan felt sustainable, I didn't notice many physical changes and I inevitably crashed 2 weeks in. I took 2 weeks off from diet + exercise due to a medical emergency and now I'm trying again on a different path. A number of sources stated that I should be consuming closer to 2700 calories to reach my goals given my current measurements and activity level. In addition to this, I should incorporate a dedicated cheat day/meal into my plan so that I stay sane- I opted for a small sweet after dinner instead of a large meal or an entire day. It makes sense... but 2700 just sounds like too much! Am I crazy? I'm worried I'll inadvertently gain fat weight because I'm not constantly moving. Then I was also told that my workout progress was stunted because I wasn't eating enough. Is that true?

diet,"I am 37 year old male and i have been working out on/off the past 10 years or so.  
I am currently 81 kilos and 179cm height - my lately Boditrax scan showed a 25.3 BMI, 16.9% fat (13.7kg) and 79% muscle (64kg).  


I want to drop my fat percentage mainly while staying toned because i have annoying spot fat around the love handles and chest.  


My problem has always been consistency, as i could go into a good routine of working out at the gym 3-4times a week while on a calorific deficit for 2 months, but then take a break and start all over again.  


As you know, after 33 years old i have found it a lot harder to lose weight and slim down, but after being introduced to intermittent fasting i am back on a good roll with diet and exercise.  


At the moment, if i am not going out i follow the below:  


\- Intermittent fasting 16:8 (22:00 to 14:00)  
\- Break fast with protein meal replacement and porridge  
\- Work out (3-4 times a week approx 90mins out of which 30mins cardio)  
\- Whey protein shake  
\- A good balanced meal  


I have dropped around 4 kilos in a month in this way and can lift more at the gym/getting stronger.  


**My question is regarding the overall calorific intake.**  


I have quite a low calorific average on MyFitnessPal, as i have my food target to 1650 and then i work out on top so it drops a lot.  
The current weekly average is around **1100** to **1200** after removing the calories from the workouts ( i track them with chest heart monitor).  


Thing is that my hunger is very manageable and when i am fasting i just have 2 cups of black coffee and a hydralyte supplement (sodium, magnesium and vitamin C) so i dont really feel i consume so little calories.  


Is this plan healthy ? Should i keep it like that for the time being at least ? What do you think?

diet," Shilajit is a blackish-brown sticky substance, that is formed by the slow decomposition of plants and minerals on the rocks of the Himalayas.  People have been using Shilajit for centuries to cure various problems from Alzheimer’s to impotence in men. 

 There are many shilajit benefits for men including increasing Male fertility and testosterone.

Testosterone is the primary sex hormone in males but some men experience low testosterone levels due to various circumstances. The symptoms of low testosterone levels include-

* A low sex drive
* Loss of hair
* Loss of muscle mass
* Fatigue
* Increased body fat

A study published in the journal Andrologia studied the effect of shilajit in 35 infertile males. During the test 100mg of shilajit in capsule form was provided to them regularly for 90 days.

The results were surprising as 28 out of 30 men showed significant increases in total sperm count, sperm motility, and the amount of healthy sperm, a measure of how well the sperm move.

Thus eating shilajit regularly may benefit men with high testosterone levels and an increase in sperm count.

I am currently trying to get into shape (working out, eating a healthier diet, etc), but there are always some days where I get a sudden craving for junk food (so far I've been pretty successful at fending off these cravings). However, this made me wonder if there has been any scientific proof on whether it is ""healthier"" to binge junk food all at once, or spread out over the course of a week (assuming you still eat as normal every day, the junk food would just be surplus Calories). (ex. Eating 7 cookies in a day VS eating 1 cookie a day over a week).

My own hypothesis is that binging it all at once would be ""healthier"" since the human stomach does not have 100% efficiency in absorbing nutrients. So if you overload the intestines in one go, you would cumulatively absorb less than if you ate it over a week, giving the intestines a better chance at absorbing more nutrients.

I would love to know if anyone has read peer-reviewed papers on this subject (please see to article if available), or even personal anecdotal evidence.

My daily diet is 4 single-serve sized yogurts and 2 packets of tuna. Totals around 600 calories a day. Can I really screw something up big time if I continue like this for like 6 months?

I also have stomach issues which doctors have not ascertained. But I've sort of figured out what to avoid to not feel too sick . Overall, if I avoid gluten, dairy, and eat natural (avoid processed/artificial/etc.) I can sort of feel OK.

Have no access to a kitchen. So easiest thing that ""works"" with my current situation and stomach issues is tuna and yogurt. If I deviate from my diet and eat McDonalds or something it kills my stomach and feel terrible for days. Plus, most fast food/restaurants are expensive and unhealthy.

Despite my situation, I workout 5x/week. Moderate/high intensity lifting and cardio.

\#1 - I'm looking for a cheap, sustainable, low maintenance diet that reaches 2k calories a day. I'm feeling the effects of eating so little calories (brain fog, weakness, etc.).

Nuts have lots of calories, but they upset my stomach. (Maybe I need to ""toughen up,"" eat nuts and deal with it, at least for now).

Eating too much gets me bloated, constipated, kills my stomach, etc. It's hard to eat a lot for me.

\#2 - Please also recommend me a diet for when I hopefully have access to a kitchen again. Because even then when I've cooked, I've had trouble reaching 2500 calories. Healthy foods often contain little calories. A typical daily diet in this situation for me has been:

In order to maintain my weight while cycling 100+ miles a week, I need about 3000-3500 calories a day. My partner is working towards similar miles but with a slower metabolism and a higher starting weight. 

The obvious answer is to cut back severely on what they eat while adjusting the types of food.

The problem is that it seems like it would be complicated for me to join her and still eat enough calories. Of course, I can eat what they eat but more. But I'm admittedly picky and while I'm improving in that respect, if it's something I don't like, I will not get enough calories.

How do we make this work? I want to support them but they cannot eat high-carb foods and it is virtually impossible for me to get enough calories through traditional diets.

- I don’t drink my calories. Coffee, water, nut milks is all I drink. 

- no alcohol 

- started therapy to help myself understand my poor relationship with food and binge eating

- I try to make meals ahead - not the best meal prepper but I do portion meals out to have something a head of time 

- I drink so much water! 120-150oz a day

- I have done my rear on cico, IF, Paleo and keto diets. I love them all and I practice a little of each to keep myself sane and also feeding my body well. 

Areas of opportunity:

- lack consistency, I fall off the wagon more than I would like

- binge snacking/eating habits 

- food triggers my brain in a way I can explain, it’s almost like I am chemically/physically addicted

diet,"So I'm 17 years old, 202cm tall, weigh 104kg and basically all the caloric need calculators out there tell me that my Basal Metabolic Rate is 2.200kcal aprox.

Taking into account my daily activity it goes up to around 3.000kcal according to these calculators and somehow my FitBit says I'm constistently burning over 3.500kcal every day, even though I wouldn't pay much attention to it due to it's well known lack of accuracy.

A few days ago I've started carefully counting calories and I've realized that I've been overestimating my calorie intake out of disbelief that it could really be that little. I mean, I would say my daily diet has been around 2.300 daily kcal, which I guess would be a normal manteinance caloric intake for an active 20yr old average height man, but for me it makes it just over the BMR.

For some years I've been around 25% body fat and slightly overweight, and haven't been able to get it down by any means, consistently losing 3-4 kg to regain them in a week in which my only ""sins"" were eating more sugar than usual through cakes or soda at a party or whatever.

So these days I've been wondering if my body is in some type of ""starvation mode"", since I've been feeling really tired and lacking of energy for the past 3-4 years, around the time I've been starting to be much taller than the rest. After doing some reserch on ""undereating"", it turns out that the body does lower the metabolism and hold on to the existing fat when it has been in a ""constant extreme caloric deficit"".

What I don't know is whether my ""caloric deficit"" is really that big, since all the examples for people who undereat are females whose BMR is 1200kcal :/, so eating 2.300kcal would seam like a no-brainer, but for a really tall and calorie-demanding body like mine, I don't know if that's ok",May I have been undereating?,1654520565

It's been three months since I've been going to the gym. Five weeks in with my last routine. It's a three days a week routine divided in chest-triceps, shoulders-legs/glutes, back-biceps; it has excercises like deadlifts, hip thrusts and back squats, military press, curls with dumbells and barbell, french press, flat bench press and so on.. 

I eat normally 5 main meals a day: 

*breakfast always with cereals and milk+coffe,

*morning snack (often an apple with some nuts, like walnuts or almonds)

*launch (always pasta/rice with vegetables or legumes like lentils, peas and chickpeas), 

*afternoon snack always with fruit (bananas, oranges in winter and peaches in summer) and a protein bar or some other kind of sweet bar,

*dinner often with meat, chicken, but sometimes also with something made out of vegetables (fish maybe one/two times a month)

I don't follow a diet, count my calories (and I don't really want to fixate on such a thing) or eat things like creatine, protein powders and such. Since I'm going to the gym, I'd like to grow more and get bigger and stronger.

I need to add that I'm also doing a PhD and I work in the lab from monday to friday, 8.30-18.30 with a launch break of 1 hour. As soon as I leave the lab at 18.30, I head out to the gym (usually on monday and tuesday).

If you believe the hype, you can eat only carbs and lose weight, eat no carbs and lose weight, eat only cabbage and lose weight…. the list goes on and on. These plans would not be popular if people didn't follow them, but it is important to be reasonable, as well.
When choosing a diet plan, avoid fad diets. These plans come and go each season, and some can even be harmful to your health. Take the time to consult your doctor, and design a weight loss plan that works for you. Your plan should allow you to lower your calorie count while consuming foods from all major food groups.
Use these guidelines to develop a diet plan that's right for you. Avoid unhealthy calorie restrictions, cutting out entire food groups, or diet pills. Take the time to consult a medical professional and tailor a diet to meet your caloric needs. You’ll be able to lose weight and keep it off effectively if you use a combination of diet and exercise to do so.

However, like last time I tried a ketogenic diet (1+ year ago) I got some real bad rash that's is driving me nuts (can't get uninterrupted sleep and having to take showers multiple times a day to get the itching down and skin lotion). 

So I've been thinking, I had no idea if this is a good idea or not, but would it be possible to loose weight (mostly from bad food habits in the past) if you'd rotate between a diet like the carnivore and carbs (I know it's kinda cancel out each other). 

**My bad habits looked like the past 20-25 years:**

Lot of pasta, lot of processed food, last 15 years lot of take away. Sedative work past 12 years, office type work, worked in warehouses before so lot of walking/running around.

During my workout I walk on the treadmill. 3.0 mph and 3.0 incline. I do this for 30 minutes, I lift some weights (not sure what the machines are called), and then I go to the elliptical for 20 minutes. That’s the end of my workout.

The issue is I don’t know how much to eat? I’d say I was eating probably around 2500 calories. I’m thinking maybe 1200 calories for a calorie deficit but I really don’t know how much I need to eat.",How many calories should I have?,1654117777

I started eating protein (ground turkey, salmon, and chicken breast), vegetables (zucchini,yellow squash, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower), banana and orange,  everyday I eat these things. and two of these: almonds and peanuts, greek yogurt, boiled egg, and cottage cheese. Iced coffee (made at home) is my treat also everyday. I do not portion yet as I'm easing into this. Drinking lots of water and going on walks. Will start some strength exercises soon.

In 2 weeks I've lost 12lbs. My fitbit says I'm losing 3k to 4k calories a day. On quick glance it looks like sodium, carbs, cholesterol, sugar, I'm on the low side.

I’ve been wanting to loose weight for a while now, and last week i finally decided to go for it.

I’ve always been heavy, not big (always heard that i don’t look my weight) and have lost (and gained) weight in the past.

I’m watching my calories and exercising every other day, (biking 40 minutes in the gym, with a little weight exercise) but i’m scared my calorie intake is too low and that my body will go into starvation mode. Which basically which means i’ll make my goals but will quickly fall back because my body is storing every bit of food.

I’m eating between 1600 and 2400 calories a day, and i burn around 500 calories every other day with exercising. I don’t particularly eat more when I exercise, it depends on my appetite.

I’m getting my calories from yogurt, muesli, oatmeal, bread, proteinpowder and whatever meal is served to me at dinner (still live at home, also i portion the food).

diet,"In march I began keto at age 33 after eating like a pig all day everyday. I emotionally ate. I habitually ate. My vice was soda and I drank enough soda from age 10 to age 33 to fill up the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The reason I began keto was I was told that I was prediabetic and needed to get my blood sugar under control. So I started at 310 and am currently 264. But I made some serious mistakes.

My huge mistake was I thought ONLY sugar was spiking insulin. I figured that as long as I ate meats and cheeses and drank sugar free diet sodas that it wouldn't effect me. The aspartame made me drink even more soda and snack more than before and I thought I was okay because again ""it wasn't sugar"".

Mistake 2 was I did not start intermediate fasting until Saturday or 8 weeks in to keto. The reason was I was doing meal prep late Friday and early Saturday morning. I was hungry for a snack so I cooked 2 sirloin steaks for a late dinner at like 1am. And I had this big pack of medium pork chops I got at Target that was sitting in my fridge a couple days. I fried them in the steak juices and they looked so good I decided to have a couple pork chops for desert. After all its not sugar!

What I found out was on Saturday I felt like garbage. The worse I have felt since I had the sugar withdrawals when I began keto. I was tired and I kept trying to jumpstart myself with caffeine and it didn't work. Then I got in touch with my friend the nutritionist who told me all the signs I exhibit are that of insulin resistant. On my break I watched Dr Berg videos and I discovered that its not just sugar that makes your insulin spike. Its stuff like protein and caffeine! I had no idea. The past 2 months I have had more meat then probably at anytime in my life. Because I was trying to fill up and be satisfied so I wouldn't resist the temptation to run to McDonalds and bing eat 50 burgers or something. And I used the caffeine (and the aspartame) as a replacement to defeat the sugar addiction/cravings.

So I fasted on Saturday night from 8pm into 12pm the next day. Then I had 2 meals Sunday and after binge watching more Dr Berg I decided to get serious. I intermediate fasted from 7:10PM Sunday to 5:45 today. I almost made it the 48 hours but I caved when I started feeling cramps and started getting cranky. 46 1/2 hours was a good start I figured.

I ate 2 roasted chicken thighs and 16oz of some homeade chilli (italian sausage, ground beef, no sugar, yellow, red and green bell peppers, no beer, deglased with a little red wine, no beans, onions, garlic and onions and salt and pepper). I felt bloated afterwards and decided not to eat the salad I brought. I have decided to not eat until tommorow. Going to regularly do the 16:8 fast. Do a big one monthly. I am getting my blood tested again in June and did schedule an apointment with a cardiologist to check my heart after years of crap eating.

First time here, and very new to dieting in general.  Ober Covid I got a pretty bad habit of super over eating (probably 3000+ kcal a day on average), so obviously I gained weight  (Im about 245 at 6'3"", so definitely too much).

It could be anything from a stomach ulcer to an ovarian cyst. They prescribed me an anti-acid and antibiotic incase it is a gastric or urinary infection. My next step will be an ultrasound and endoscopy if my symptoms don’t get better. 

Anyways, I need to figure out what I should be eating during the next few days. I’ve noticed that my pain significantly decreases when I have something to eat.

diet,"Hey guys. I'm unfamilar with the health and diet side of Reddit, so let me know if there's a better place to post this instead. 

I'm currently 21 years old and started going vegan at 14. When I made the decision, it was mostly because of my compassion for animals and my concern for the environment, with any health benefit being a plus. Now that I'm older, I have a much more nuanced way of looking at things, and I pay a lot more attention to my health and wellbeing. Lately I've been concerned with the fact that I've been on such a restrictive diet for so long, especially during such an important developmental time. I struggle with mental health issues and I experience negative physical symptoms daily, such as dizziness, nausea, and headaches. Though I can't determine the exact cause of these symptoms, I figure that making sure my diet is well balanced and my health is taken care of is a good foundation for managing them. This has lead me to wanting a more dependable source of B12, aminos, omegas etc. in my diet. I currently take supplements, but I still find myself craving a more well balanced diet.

Though I no longer am morally opposed to the consumption of animals, I still am very uncomfortable with animal agriculture, especially due to its unsustainability. I have done a lot of research on non-vegan foods, and have come up with two options that are satisfactory to me in terms of ethics and sustainability: bivalves and insects. Bivalves do not have a brain or a nervous system capable of feeling pain. The farming of oysters in particular can actually be beneficial to the environment, because they filter the water. Insects were something that randomly occured to me, and so I started researching. Apparently over 2 billion people consume insects every day. They are a good source of protein, omegas, and B12, and are filling but low in calories. The farming of insects is sustainable and is done in a way which I would assume would be painless, which is slowly freezing them until they are unconcious. Some commonly consumed insects include crickets, silkworms, grasshoppers, cockroaches, and mealworms. I found something called cricket flour, which is what you think it is. I am interested in trying this product in particular.

My proposed diet would be my current diet, but with oysters and cricket flour added in on certain days, just enough to keep that balance. I still do want to keep my diet mostly plant-based. This is my current diet:
Breakfast - whole wheat toast with vegetable oil ""butter""
Lunch - Soy-based patty on bun, with a carb (rice or pasta), lentils or chickpeas, vegetables (carrots, kale/spinach, or broccoli), lots of fruit, nuts (almonds, peanuts, sunflower seeds), nutritional yeast, and a glass of orange juice.
Dinner - varies but usually a stew or chili with beans, lentils, potato, tomato, sometimes vegan soy or pea based beef immitation.

diet,"I have experimented a bit with my diet. I am not overweight (aprox 15% bodyfat) and train quite a lot. My goal with the diets I try out is to maximize well being, energy and training optimization. 

I have tried low carb diets, I think the lowest amounts of carbs daily I have eaten for extended times is about 50 grams. However I have had occasional days, maybe 1 a week where I do eat meals with more carbs (a pizza etc). 

From what I remember I did get a bit tired after switching back to low carbs the following days but I am not sure. My question is if it is expected to get a bit low energy if you are on a low carb diet and then eat carbs and then stop eating carbs again. My thinking of what I think I have read is that the body has to get used to low carbs again and that takes a while so in the meantime you get a small ""keto flu"". I guess it is not optimal to get a small keto flu like 4 times a month if that is the case.

diet,"I'm 21 (M), 183cm (height, 52kg (weight). I've been  ±52kg for the past 7 years. My BMI ([https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/)) is 15.5

I  never went to the doctor to get a proper diagnosis or opened up to  professionals about my problem. For the majority of life, I thought that  my body and eating ""habits"" (not really habits because my diet never  depended on me) were normal. As I grew older, I looked at my past and  realized that I've been underfed and ""starved"" for my whole bringing up.

I'm  not asking for anyone to give me a diagnosis, though I would appreciate  if anyone can suggest one. I have a hard time eating food, mostly  chewing and swallowing (probably caused by my way of eating). I cannot  eat large quantities of food, and generally don't have the biggest  appetite. Although I want to (mentally) eat normally and gain weight, my  body is not used to it due to over 2 decades of abuse (not eating  enough, horrible diet). When I eat, I aim to eat as fast as possible and  to swallow as quickly as I can — eating isn't necessarily an activity I  enjoy. Basically, when I eat, I aim to get food from A to B as fast as  possible. It's not as though I swallow whole foods or anything like  that, it's just that I physically and mentally don't enjoy the process  of eating — whether that's because of the food that I'm eating or not, I  cannot confirm.

To give a short  backstory, my parents never properly fed me, my mother to this day makes  1 meal a day, sometimes not even that. My diet currently consists of  eating small things, maybe 2-4 sandwitches a day (4 is mostly when  mother doesn't prepare a meal a day). The food that I eat isn't  nutritious, it's mostly snacks, things to kill the sensation of hunger.

From  my understanding, anorexia usually includes people purposefully not  eating enough, but in my case it's an outside factor (my parents) that  is causing me to eat poorly.

I  have the will to gain weight, but because there is a lack of food in my  household, I am unable to do that in a healthy way. The only food  resource that I have a lot of are eggs. Currently I have a lot of  chicken and turkey eggs.

TL;DR —  Am underweight because of bad eating habits caused by parents and the  lack of food in the house. I do not enjoy or strive to stay underweight,  but lack of food and my body are preventing me from changing my  ""condition""

So, recently I tried  to bring something nutritious in my ""diet"". I cannot stand boiled or  cooked eggs (taste), so I decided to make a ""protein"" shake that  consists of: 1 banana, 3 raw turkey eggs, a little bit of milk,  sometimes a little bit of sugar. I would mash the banana, stir (idk if  this is the correct term) raw eggs in a bowl, put the two together in a  bottle, add some milk, and then mix this and drink it all at once. I  made two of these milkshakes a day, but my body couldn't handle it.

After three days, I had bad stomach aches/cramps and was constipated. I had a mild diarrhea.

Is  there anything I  can do to stop my body's reaction? I wish I could  have something else in my diet as of now, but eggs are my only hope and  the only thing that I know I have a lot of. Down the line I would like  to add some oatmeal to my diet.

Mcdonalds Hot N Spicy's, Jackass in the box tacos, Whoppers and chicken nuggets etc on top of chips everyday. I loved pringles and would eat a whole stack of pringles on the way home after work. 

So from then on eliminate all fast food (except Chipotle bowl without rice and beans), eliminated  all rice, pasta, bread and starchy or sugary veggies such as squash, corn, potatoes, carrots and peas.

Water/Diet Soda/Almond Milk/unsweet tea/white monster energy drinks (because white Rockstar has Malterodextin)  


Chicken, beef, pork, fish either fried or roasted in natural fats. Canned tuna/sardines. I bought lunch meat or pepperoni at stores while on the go as a snack. I also have eggs and bacon a lot for breakfast.   


Frozen broccoli florets, asparagus, onions, garlic, cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, bell peppers and serrano/jalapeno/pablano chillies and celery. Blueberries and strawberries.  


Sharp or extra sharp cheddar and swiss cheese as a snack.  Thats it. Pretty much all the way hippie besides the meat and cheese. I cut out regular milk and fruits because of the sugar.

Can someone please answer some questions for me about white rice. I am so confused. There is so much contradictory information on the internet it is honestly so frustrating.

I am a marathon runner. I run a lot. I have been told that white rice is an excellent meal to consume before a 10-20 mile run because it fills your glycogen stores.

At the same time, people say that we need to be cutting ""refined sugars"" out of our diets...? Then they go as far as to refer to White Rice as a ""refined sugar"" like it's similar to a box of Mike and Ike's.

Isn't white rice simple brown rice with the germ removed? It's less calories and less nutritional value. Why are people demonizing it like it's eating candy? I understand all carbohydrates are sugar, but what gives?

Also, it's ""high on the glycemic index"" and thus if you eat it, it ""spikes blood sugar"" which can lead to chronic disease?

Is that just in the case of lazy people who smash rice and then lay on the couch and do nothing letting it turn into fat?

diet,"In the past 1.5 years, I (29/f) lost a considerable amount of weight. I started at just over 80kg and am now weighing in at around 53kg. I don't even know where all of that weight was shed from tbqh as I'm just shy of 6'. I didn't resort to any binge-dieting or crazy things like skipping meals, cutting out carbs, or what have you. The only thing I can think is to 'blame' is that I moved out and have been living on my own so it's much easier to not only monitor your intake (of meals as well as snacking in between), but you also have no one to blame but yourself if the scale starts going up.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, enough about that. My family is starting to feel extremely toxic to me whenever I come home to visit them. My mom, especially, will harp on me about how I'm sick, I'm anorexic, I don't look well, I look exactly like concentration camp prisoners, etc.. Those comments all strike me as completely out of line but the worst, imo, is when she finishes off her rant(s) by saying that I'm not even aware of how skinny I look (based on her assumption. I'm aware of the weight loss and how it would probably even look better if I gained a few kilo but to have my self-awareness completely discounted like that is really something else).

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be 100% up for seeing a dietician as I truly have nothing to hide. I eat heaps of veggies, lots of protein, and probably the least amount amount of carbs from all the food groups (still have them but went down from two slices of toast for breakfast to one, for example).

When I did nothing and sat around I used to be hungry all the time but these days I just eat a couple meals and one of them is just fruits but I don't get too hungry really.

Before last year I used to do boxing competitively before I left it entirely to concentrate on studies. This used to happen those days too, when a tournament was approaching I would turn up the intensity and hours of my training and for some reason I would see a sharp decrease in hunger throughout the day.

The same is happening right now but it's much more noticable cause I haven't done any exercise at all in the last one year and only sat and ate like a glutton but as I started working out again I don't feel too hungry anymore, whereas a month ago eating only twice and in such small amounts would've been unbearable.

Just joined this subreddit, and I wanted to share something that I have found that I thought would be interesting to share with all of you.

“Effortless” and “weight loss” don’t seem like they belong in the same sentence.

At least that’s what I thought.

Until I read this FREE Ebook.

**file:///C:/Users/admin/Downloads/BioFit-Eat-for-8-2021.6%20(4).pdf**

In that Ebook, I learned about a few major breakthroughs in weight loss science that I had never heard of before.

And one of these breakthroughs actually allows you to eat all kinds of junk, and lose weight in the process.

How is that possible?

The creator of that Ebook is a genius. That’s how.

She’s at least 5 years ahead of where current weight loss science is...

And I LOVE his video...

So get focused.

Close the door.

And read this book until the very end... (and don’t skim read, give it a full read, trust me)

Your mind will be blown and you’ll start dropping pounds immediately afterward.

Grilled cheese...

Sushi....

Doughnuts....

It’s all BACK on the table...

That’s why she calls it the “Favourite Food Diet”

I promise...a diet will never get easier than this...

It will never be more fun than this...

And as a result you’re going to STICK with this for the long haul.

That’s why she has so many incredible case studies to go along with his diet.

diet,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a 29yo 5 foot 10 male who started out weighing 254. I decided to start dieting the beginning of March. Since then I've dropped down to about 236 pounds but I seem to have hit a wall. I know the plateau is normal, i just had a couple of questions about how my exercise is impacting my weight loss.

Current calorie intake goal is to stay under 2k calories a day.

Before I started dieting I was basically sedentary for the last 5-6 years. I'm talking less than 5k steps a day and pretty much 0 exercising.

I started out going to the gym in March for about 30-45 minutes a day, 3 days a week. I'm now up to 5-6 days a week of going to the gym and doing aerobic exercises for 45minutes to an hour. I track everything on my samsung watch and I'm usually burning 500-650 calories everytime I go. So far I've really enjoyed it, I have minor soreness and some back pain but usually stretches and rest solve that issue.

My fiancee has continually said she's noticed the weight loss and can see where I've slimmed down (she's very supportive). But I've gotten a little frustrated by the actual lack of pounds lost. I know i should just focus on the health benefits of exercise and eating healthy (which I have been). It just seems like from all the stuff I've read that I should be atleast dropping a pound a week...and that hasn't been the case.

Just wanted to see if I'm doing something really wrong or if this is normal. My fiancee said that it's possible I'm just offsetting fat loss with muscle gain because I was so sedentary before, which makes sense, I just haven't been able to find sources out there claiming that that would happen at this high of a rate.

diet,"Hi all 28/M 
Due to the pandemic, gyms closing and depression being on the rise I put a shed load of weight on during the 3 or so months of work, now I’m back at the gym and have been going for about 2 months so far, all the muscle I made before the pandemic seems to have inflated back up and come right back, I’m really happy about this but only problem is I’ve got bigger boobs and  curvier hips than Nicki Minaj, Any ideas on a diet or plan to shred the fat? I was thinking to try a calorie deficit as I’m not to bothered about loosing muscle at this time, my mental and physical state can work perfectly on around 800 calories a day so I’m thinking about trying that but people have said it’s bad and dangerous blah blah blah but if anyone has a more knowledgeable approach on how to shred fat or on what foods to eat I’m completely open to give it a try,

diet,"Hi everyone, 

I am new to this sub, so if this is not allowed please let me know and I will remove the post. I could not find anything in the rules regarding this.

Right now I am on a health journey because I cannot figure out what is wrong with my body. I am pescatarian. Since I was a kid I have become ill after eating meat. To the point where I would throw up sometimes. Now that I have the means to do so, I became pescatarian around 5 years ago. 

I did a food sensitivity test through my naturopath doctor along with some other tests. I have severe intolerances to gluten, dairy, and refined sugars eaten with fruit together along with an iron deficiency. This limits my options quite a lot. I am wondering if anyone has some meal recommendations that I can try? Meals that are high in iron? I just cannot eat fish and rice for the rest of my life. Does anyone have any recommendations for sites I can look on for finding meals I can eat that are healthy?

diet,"Hey there internet. I won’t keep this message up to long but I needed to get this off my chest.

So me and weight loss have had a rough time together. A few years back I managed to lose 19lbs but I did it through very bad means. (800cal or less a day) and I can honestly say it was one of the worst times of my life. I’m only 20 but when I ate like this I would be constantly in a bad mood, super forgetful and cry at well everything. My grades dropped and I was tired all the time but I didn’t care cause my weight was going down. Every time I started eating a meal I would stop half way and feel sick if I ate any more. Luckily I got out of that routine but I then put on all the weight I had lost. 
I’ve tried dieting healthily but I never seem to last beyond 5lbs and it’s always back on within a month. 
So why start again now? Well I live at uni but recently visited home. I left a pair of underwear behind by mistake and my mother starting arguing my my brother that they belonged to his gf because they couldn’t possibly be mine because they were too small for me.
It kinda just hit me again that my family view me as fat. 
When I’ve tried loosing weight in the past it’s been for healthy reasons but this is the first time since the horrible diet trip that I’d be losing weight for a toxic reason. I know people will say I should ignore them and just be happy in myself but I can’t be. I’m scared it’s going to end up the same way it went before with me being very toxic toward myself and have my uni degree suffer because of how I eat. 
I just don’t know where to go from here.

Tldr: Mother implied I’m fat and scared to loose weight due to previous bad dieting experience.

Basically all the sugar I eat comes from vegetables, fruits, cottage cheese, and a touch from cream (coffee), and once a week some 85% dark chocolate. I generally don't eat sweets, preserves, baked goods, etc. 

So although I'm consuming around 40 grams of sugar per day, it's all from the food I'm eating, meaning, I don't believe it's added sugar. 

Let's use cottage cheese as an example. 2% fat variety. It contains, according to the label, 6 grams of carbs, 5 of which is labeled as 'sugar'. Is this added sugar, or just sugar from lactose? 

I guess what I'm asking is, how can I differentiate between added sugars and natural sugars, or should I just keep the total number of sugars around or under my 30 gram limit (which is what is recommended for a man my age/size).",Need clarity on sugar labelling,1651965535

diet,"Long story short, I’ve eaten a terrible (normal) diet for my whole life. I’m 19 now. I’ve come to the realization that the back pain I’ve been experiencing in my upper right lat for 4 years and some other things is due to inflammation in my body caused by diet. I’ve been debilitatingly anxious since as long as I can remember.

(Skip to the last paragraph to get to the main point.)

When I eat something that doesn’t agree with me, I get ear ringing, constant anxious and depressive (sometimes suicidal) thoughts, get pale, etc., and genuinely overthink everything to the point where if I’m at a green light I’ll make sure there’s no imaginary signs I made up that doesn’t exist in case I’m violating a traffic law. Seriously it’s debilitating.

Last year I got severe cystic acne for about a year and it was dreadful. 100% caused by diet. Cleared up now, but I was eating junk for months on end at the time.

Over the last month, I haven’t been working, and in the mornings eat chocolate chip cookies with an iced coffee every morning. Lemonade throughout the day, big carb dish for dinner. I felt like I was going insane for the last month, I’ve been so anxious and doubting my every move, psychoanalyzing EVERYTHING that comes in my way. I noticed my feet actually started getting kind of tingly maybe three weeks in, and my hand was getting numb strumming my guitar. It was really concerning and thought I had a cardiovascular issue.

Now, four days ago, I stopped eating junk and just ate clean meat and some veggies from the fridge because I thought it might have to do with that. I felt really good, but that night I was home alone for dinner so I had 1/2 a lasagna and two ginger ales.

That night I started hallucinating, seeing actual faces. It was one of the worst feelings I’ve ever had. It was like I was just frozen in terror. The next day I was totally wiped out, angry and uber anxious to where I hid out in my room while my family was over for a birthday… Damn… it’s hard when you can’t break free from that anxious loop and it made me feel pretty bad.

The day after that, I was feeling 85% better in the morning. That day I only ate meat. I had a steak for lunch, and a steak for dinner. I felt like I was on top of the world. I wasn’t depressed or anxious at the end of the day, and my skin looks WAY red-healthier and my thoughts were super clear. I felt like I was an electric car. My back didn’t hurt, and was having meaningful conversations with my family.

I had three eggs later that night, felt wiped, right lat hurt, ear ringing, and body pains. So I was like hmm, well I’m in pain so I might as well make sure food particularly is causing me all of my issues. So I ate a big slice of chocolate cake. And I felt wiped. The next morning my depression and suicidal thoughts came back for the morning. I just sat there for an hour in the family room after falling asleep on the couch. In misery, unable to think for myself.

Today I’ve just eaten a steak for lunch and chicken wings for dinner. Felt pretty good but my head really hurts, I think it’s because I haven’t had a lot of sugar in a few days and I have an ear infection so that’s clearing up. Tonight I had some smoked turkey lunch meat. Back pain is back, stomach burns and is just growling. It’s not as anxious as the last time (I was afraid of leaving my house because of the thought of allowing those thoughts to fester into reality). Maybe the chemical smoke flavouring in the meat didn’t agree with me (it’s not food poisoning, all my symptoms are just back).

I am aware that there’s someone named Michaela Peterson who has had similar issues if not way worse symptoms, but I’ve noticed I exhibit almost scarily similar symptoms…. She went to only eating meat and salt and is now healthy. (as bullshit as it sounds, but if that can help me clear these issues up, just the possibility of that brings a tear to my eye).

Skip to here.

(If I eat anything other than meat, my depressive anxious loop thoughts come back and my back hurts and tinnitus and shoulder aches).

Even me writing this whole thing, I am thinking the reader will think I am over explaining everything and they are just gonna think I’m crazy sick. 

Basically, I think out of desperation because all of this is just too much for me to bear, I need to try to only eat meat, no additives, and just see how it works for me after a little bit, maybe a month. Does anyone have any similar experience with this? Any help here would be appreciated.",I’m not sure what’s wrong with me lol,1651653119

diet," 

270 lbs / 5'9

Hey guys, as the title suggests since 2019 I have made several attempts to try to lose weight. Each unsuccessful. I try many different diets. All these changes are initially successful, with me losing multiple lbs over the course of months, but I then go back to my ways eventually. I don't go on fad diets, all my diets are just based on portion control and watching calories.

My ""usual"" diet consists of me eating out. I usually eat out and eat very large restaurant portion sizes for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Most days I eat 2 large restaurant plates, and 3 on some days.

In my first attempt, I tried to use a delivery meal prep service. They came and delivered food. On the second attempt, I tried to cook for myself by going to the supermarket and cooking every day. On the third attempt, I tried to eat only meal-prepped chicken and rice for lunch and dinner and eggs for breakfast. This was the worst one, and this is the only diet change that lasted a week. I eventually started to stop tasting my food after the first week. Everything tasted like mush. On the fourth attempt, I used hello fresh to deliver my ingredients and recipes, so I don't have to go to the supermarket and just follow recipes rather than research what I want to eat that week.

I used myfitnesspal to keep track of my calories in/out. I also exercised with walks or biking.

All failed and I started to notice thse 3 similarities between each one

1. Hunger,  
After the first couple of months, I start to get very hungry. So hungry that even having a usual cheat meal (Just a regular restaurant meal on my normal diet) won't help alleviate it. I tried using coffee to suppress the hunger, but it just won't go down. This is usually my breaking point where I convert back to my original diet, so I won't stop feeling so hungry all the time.
2. Fatigue,  
I notice this 1-3 weeks before my unbearable hunger comes in. I become way more exhausted than usual. I usually have to get to bed immediately after 8 PM. This does help my sleeping schedule and I do get great sleep from this, but I do feel way more exhausted throughout the day.
3. Palette change,  
my palette changes consistently throughout the weeks. Eating the same meal for multiple weeks or the same 3 meals for the course of months will lead to my food tasting like mush. To the point, I won't eat or force myself to eat. Really takes out the fun of eating and makes me kinda miserable

diet," 

Good afternoon everyone!; Could you help me try to debunk these myths and doubts about food and nutrition? There are times when the surplus of available information makes it difficult to search in truly reliable sources. I thank you in advance. Happy weekend!

1. Do only carbohydrates increase blood sugar levels?

2) In an order from least to greatest feeling of satiety; Which macronutrient (fats, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, protein) makes you feel full longer?

3) In order from lowest to highest, which macronutrient (fats, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, proteins) most successfully delays the increase in blood sugar levels

4) It is already known for a fact that eating more frequently does not have a positive impact on our health (as long as you are consuming the necessary daily calories and as long as it is healthy food); well you may not be very hungry at the next meal, but again, this is not a problem if you eat healthy food. My question is, how true is it that if you eat very often food rich in carbohydrates, there is a chance of storing fat due to the action of insulin. Shouldn't this happen once your daily energy needs are met?

5) Does it make sense to eat just out of habit or because it's time to eat? Due to work schedules I get up a little late and I'm not hungry in the morning, and I consider it stupid to eat a snack at 11 a.m. and then have lunch at 12; what do you think is the most useful and easy to keep up with? I believe that eating out of habit can lead to poor food choices, not being able to distinguish the signs of real hunger and even worse, to a hormonal imbalance in terms of ghrelin and leptin

And finally, how true is the statement that to gain or lose weight you need to consume 500 kcal less /more per day? Does this really work like this way? Isn't it really necessary to have a chronic caloric surplus in order to ""get fat""? For example, if I ate 500 fewer calories per day, after a week I would have eaten 3,500 fewer calories, which is approximately what a normal weight and active person should consume in one day; would this really imply an increase of 1 kg of body fat?",Could you please help to cast a bit of certainty on these doubts regarding human nutrition?,1651352138

diet,"TL;DR: Cannot find fruit or veg that is anything better than barely tolerable to eat. Not sure how to proceed.

I am a 23 year old male and its been about 10 years since I was forced to eat fruit and veg with every meal by my parents. My mom is a vegetarian and my dad loves all kinds of food and went to culinary school, so I have tried both fruit and veg in a wide variety and prepared in all sorts of ways. To the best of my memory, never in my life have I tried a dish with fruit or veg included where I find the dish to be better off with their inclusion. Quite the opposite, actually. If lettuce or pickle is put on a burger I love, it will ruin it for me. If mushrooms are included in a lasagna I love, I no longer enjoy eating it. My weight does not fluctuate and I have been around 190lbs for years, but I know how horrible this is for my long term health. My goal is to be able to get the nutrients and vitamins that I need without absolutely dreading the act of eating my food, but if I have to hate every meal I eat to improve my health, I am ready to accept that reality at this point. I am not adverse to the thought of eating fruit and veg, it is quite literally the taste that kills it for me. 

My questions are: Will I grow to like some of these things? How long can I expect be disgusted by my food until things begin to improve? How much should I aim to eat/should I start slow or dive right into consuming the daily recommended amount? Any help or harsh criticism is appreciated. Thanks.

Male/36/179.5cm/80.2kg

I have trained for 3-4 years now, and have built some muscle. I want to go on the journey of lowering my body fat. i bought Withthings body composition scale and it puts me around 20-22% bodyfat. I know its not accurate, im just using to see what direction im going. I want to go on lowering bodyfat journey.

I have started using Lifesum app on my phone. i have set a goal for lowering my weight slowly. It puts me on 1600 calories to eat everyday. Thats fine.

After using online protein calculator, i need to eat around 180g of portein everyday. I have eating as much protein i can, also drinking 3 whey-80 proteinshakes everyday. Im currently on my 9th day now. Lifesum tells me that im eating around 60-80g fat everyday aswell.

So basically im around -600 calories everyday, with 180g protein intake. Thats while im hitting the gym for lifting weights.

Im just wondering if im doing it right? isnt protein and fat calories aswell? do you guys have any tips for me? if i keep doing this my body fat will lower over time, and i remain some of my muscle?

Also on the days i dont workout, do i need to keep eating 180g+ protein those days too or overloading with protein are only for workout days?",Am i doing it right?,1651310179

Ideally, I’m looking to become more lean and have less body fat. I really want to hit this goal and I think my diet isn’t awful but I think it needs some improvements. I will give you a rough idea of what a day over the weekday looks like:

Breakfast: three eggs (usually scrambled with about a tablespoon of butter) and English breakfast tea with a splash of milk and no sugar.

Lunch: this varies a lot but when I’m trying to be really good it’s usually a chicken breast, lettuce, onion and a tablespoon of salad cream.

Dinner: Some form of lean meat - chicken breast, wit vegetables that might be in some kind of stir fry etc (I don’t use oil to cook my food due to the extra calories) and the sauces for my foods are made using fresh herbs rather than out of a jar.

Then some chocolate (my downfall) like a small Kit Kat with another cup of tea.

I ate well up until my parents speeperated and divorced when I was 10, after that I was eating a lot of convenience foods and junk. When I was 15-17 I played football in high school and was in the best shape of my life. Could run 8 minute miles, practically did every day and was doing serious weight training and strength conditioning 4-5 days out of the week, all of that combined with 3-4 hours of JV football practice 4-5 days a week. I wasn't absolutely shredded, and muscle builds on my body strangely since I have really long extremities. But I miss it. I know that degree of physical exertion is probably not healthy for me now, but I want to be more comfortable with my body be able to appreciate my body. 

I'm focused on weight loss primarily, and after I lose some body fat I want to make my gains back, at least to a certain extent.

 My question is what can y'all recommend? I know the basics, eat under your base metabolic rate by a little ( calculators tell me to maintain I should eat around 2,500 calories a day, not sure how accurate that is) so based on that, I should eat like 2,000-2,100 a day. Gotta reduce simple and complex carbs, but not eliminate them, don't over restrict and end up yo-yo-ing, a pound of fat is 3,500 calories, healthy weight loss is 1-2lbs a month, etc. 

But what meals can you recommend? What stuff is good to eat or include in meals that will help with satiety while helping me meet my weight loss and dieting goals? Would love to hear what you all currently eat or did that helped you in your journey.

I'm so scared my diet is bad. I feel like I'm snacking a lot.

My diet is:

Weekdays: no breakfast

lunch: 1-2 cups rice (white or brown) with sauteed vegetables and tofu

Snack: vegetables with hummus and vegan cheese (lots of hummus)

Lots of coffee or tea with milk throuhgout the day.

My teachers also give us candy sometimes idk why we're in high school but I'll have like 1-2 twizzlers or something to snack on, Maybe one of those mini sour patch kids bags. I'm trying to avoid those though.

Dinner: same thing as lunch (dining hall doesn't have a lot of options)

I have cereal with milk and peanut butter and banana for dessert.

I also run 4 miles 4-6 times a week.

My current diet macro split is 35%C, 35%P and 30%F, at 2453 k/cal which I've found puts me in a very slight caloric surplus (approx. +50 k/cal daily), my goal being body recompositing (gaining muscle and losing fat simultaneously). As I very well fall into the ""newbie gains"" category, have decent genetics and around 13-15% body fat I know that body recomp is possible for me, however my only concern is the foods I get my protein from.

My current strict diet I've made and adjusted over the last few weeks gives me 217g protein, 217g carbs and 74g fat, however I've calculated that 141g of that protein comes from whole foods, eggs = 12.7g, chicken breast = 35.6g, and tuna = 39.5, the remaining of that comes from things such as oats, rice, milk etc. I am concerned because that means I'm taking in 76g of my protein from whey protein shakes and protein bars, (2 scoops of whey per day 1 mixed with milk and 1 mixed in my oats, as well as 2 protein bars per day). Is this something I should be concerned about?

So my plan is to drop down to 90-94kg as that's the weight i feel and look good at.

My usual day looks like this:

Breakfast: 3 hard boiled eggs 
Lunch: Chicken breast on olive oil (no air fryer or any of those fancy pots that do not require any oil haha) with either lettuce/tomatoes/broccoli or something in that category
Snacks: Banana or apple and 200g some protein chocolate pudding (160cal with 20g protein on 200g of a container)
Dinner: This is where it gets tricky as i really have no dinner plans and i usually check my calorie count and give myself a 'cheat meal' in means of eating anything interesting as long as i don't push through calorie limit.  

With mentioned food i never go over 2000 cal per day, as is my idea to speed up the weight loss process, BUT i'm starting to lose my focus as i'm always eating the same things, preparing them the same way and experiencing the same tastes every day.  
I live in Serbia and all those fancy and weird recipes online really don't help because i either get lost or cannot track the calorie intake with them (i.e. don't know if something is good or bad for me to eat because of the difference in products in my country)  

So what are some good recipes i should and could try out, and is there anything in my diet i should change or add?  

Fair to mention, currently not using any supplementation but planning on taking a whey protein (to switch out protein pudding due to cost per month) and creatine (suggestion from a friend for higher volume in training as well in energy levels during the day) - so if anyone has an opinion on this i'd love to hear it!

diet,"Hey, 

I'm trying to create a healthier food timetable for the week for myself. I intend to still do my own research after work but having a template from others more experienced to build off and further tailor to my situation would be helpful.

I don't take breakfast (although that could change depending on any advice given here) so I eat just twice a day -- mostly around 12:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. I use to take a lot of sugary drinks but I'm cutting down on them because they make me feel lethargic when I take them with a meal. 

I have 3 major things I'm looking for with my food timetable:

* I don't want to feel tired after each meal. Food coma has been a problem for a while. I eat and then for the next hour or even more after eating a meal, my cognitive abilities get affected.
* I want each meal to be filling for at least 4 hours. After 12:30 p.m. or 1 p.m., I'm not really looking to eat a meal again until 6. I'm open to snacking though.  
* I want to make sure I'm not deficient in nutrients and that each day I'm eating something well rounded. 

Now, on to what I have available to me each day. I live in a developing country so I don't have a lot of options available. The standard meal I can get each day includes:

* White rice (Parboiled long-grain rice white rice)
* Beans 
* Chicken 
* Beef
* Fish
* Eggs (boiled or fried)
* Beef and chicken sausages 
* A salad
* Yams 
* Spaghetti with a sauce
* Noodles (Instant noodles; stir fry)
* Bread (sugar bread)
* Fruits are also available (Pineapples, oranges, apples, watermelons, etc.)

**Note: These options can be combined in a variety of ways and there are other things I left out to avoid cluttering this post.** 

If you can't do a Monday - Sunday timetable, I'd appreciate pointers on what needs to be part of each meal, the ratios to prevent food coma, and any other theories on nutrition I can use to tailor it down. 

**If it's of any importance, I'm not a very active guy but I've resolved to take evening walks and jog at least once a week for the next month.**

This is an issue i’ve had my entire life, and i am incredibly embarrassed by it. but now that i live on my own, i have learned how unhealthy my eating habits are. If it helps, i’ve always had very bad anxiety and have recently started being medicated for it. that may be a factor but i don’t know.

Foods have always been tough for me and super embarassing to the point where i couldnt eat in front of people for a while. I’ve always been a picky eater. Could never drink juices and sodas, and had to learn to deal with milk. Could never really do mashed potato’s, chinese food outside of plain chow mein, sushi, mexican food outside of cheese quesadillas and burritos with only beans cheese and rice, and have always liked my burgers plain. just now recently starting to like rice. The thought of apple sauce makes me want to vomit. Growing up, i would have vegetables and stuff at dinner and could not get them down, yet was forced to stay at the dinner table until i finished my plate. i absolutely depise the taste/texture of all vegetables, especially broccoli and asparagus. carrots, too. i don’t know what it is, but that bitter taste triggers me and instantly makes me gag. the last time i had broccoli, i threw it all back up. 

I cant do many fruits either. I kinda like bananas, but that’s really it. Oranges and stuff are way too bitter and sour for me, grapes, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries all have this really gross sweetness and texture that make me physically repulse. i love strawberry FLAVORED things, but strawberries themselves are a no go. apples also make me incredibly nauseous, due to its weird unfulfilling, almost flat kind of taste. Avocado i hear is really great, and i’d be willing to try it cuz i kind of like guacamole.

I don’t know how to get over this. i’ve tried it a bit, but whenever I even think about eating these, my stomach churns and i get super flustered and can’t eat for at least half an hour once it’s out of my mind. To get my vitamins i take 2 vitamin D pills and a multivitamin every day so i’m good on all that. I’ve thought of making maybe strawberry banana shakes, since i love that gogurt flavor, but i’m not sure what to mix in with it. i know i could put in like greens and stuff and granola and i wouldn’t even taste it, i just don’t know which ones. i also don’t work out so i don’t know about like protein powder and stuff cuz everyone always recommends that. i just don’t know what to do and this constantly eats away at me.

I have been struggling to get my BMI/weight down to a healthy measure, currently I am obese. Two years ago, when I stepped on a scale after highschool ( I was extremely active in highschool weighing in at 220lbs) I did a lot of heavy lifting for football, and track and field, exercising 5 days a week. After my senior year of football, I started eating tons of sweets and junk food, staying up really late playing video games, and falling into a depression spiral with my ex girlfriend. At the start of our break up, I weighed 262 lbs, and managed to drop to a weight of 232LBS through a 4 month span. During this time I changed my diet while still eating 3 meals a day and relevant snacks. I was living with my parents and had a job that isn't as active as my job now. Since then I have gained 13 lbs, and currently weigh 245 lbs, and I don't know how to diet and drop my weight. Everything that I have tried isn't working. Currently I work at chipotle, as a service manager. I put away the truck in the morning which is throwing boxes of food on shelves for 30 minutes straight. I do this on top of an exercise routine that I do 3-5 times a week. I start my day by going to holiday to get coffee and I often use about 150 calories in added creamers/ syrups., and pair that with an apple, 2 granola bars, 1 cup of granola, or skip breakfast. While I eat chipotle I eat a salad 2 of the days that I work, a bowl for 2 more bowls, then a burrito or quesadilla about once a week, I watch my portion sizes of rice, and beans because they often cause much of the calories. I get about a 4th of a portion of queso and a 1/2 portion of cheese. This is my main lunch meal. I then come home and eat whole foods for dinner 3 of the 7 days. I often cook chicken and pair it with raw broccoli and a little bit of ranch, a salad with hardboiled eggs, and lunch meat, or pork loins. The other days I will often eat something like a pizza, or pasta, however I keep it under 1000 calories, some days I am still full and skip dinner, and do a light snack. I will do about half a cup of ice-cream, or a treat 2-3 days out of the week. With this my total calories per day is around 2000=2500 calories.

I’m still pretty much eating keto (less than 39 Net carbs per day) with a protein goal of 97g per day and between 1000-1200 calories per day. I’ve lost about 15 pounds so far. I’d like to lose 30-40 more.

The problem is, I can easily be full and satisfied on less than 800 calories per day. I never used to even count calories on keto before but I’m trying to be more conscious of it now and I know that eating too little can stall weight loss just as well as eating too much. 

Should I be forcing myself to eat 200-300 more calories per day just to get 1000 calories? Or should I just continue the way I’m going and not worry about it?

I want this weight gone and don’t want to get in my own way. I’m mad at myself for even gaining all of this back. 🙄 I was only 12lbs from my ultimate goal weight before I fell off the wagon.","(31f) Trying to lose weight, not eating enough calories, should I force myself to eat more?",1649346427

diet,"Hi Guys,

I'm currently trying to shred body fat, but I'm concerned nothing is happening...

It's been approximately 2 weeks and the scales have stayed at 70kg (172cm tall btw).

My diet consists of a variation of the same food items every day, and I never cheat. Not even a single chip. These food items are; Eggs, Green/Red Peppers, Carrots, Chicken, Light Greek Yoghurt, Strawberries, Bananas, Raisins, Oats, Protein Powder. 

I weigh absolutely everything, so my calorie count shouldn't be off, and even if it is ever so slightly off, my 2 week average is 1100 calorie intake. (I still get over 150g of protein in every day)

I do approx 2 hours gym every day, so maybe I'm gaining muscle and losing fat at the same rate? But still, I'm not noticing any huge changes in my body physique so I'm getting a bit despondent....

Does anyone have any tips for shredding body fat?

I feel like I've tried everything including seeking health advice from professionals but I've just been dismissed as ""not a medical issue"". This is really starting to depress me so posting here on the off chance someone else has been through similar.

My background:
- Obese my entire life, 125kg at highest, 5ft 8
- 2017 started the keto diet. Lost weight rapidly.
- August 2019 I was at 75kg. Went on a month long holiday to east Asia, came off Keto for the trip. Despite lots and lots of exercise (including climbing Mount fuji) came back as 82kg. Note in order to get down to 75kg I was doing some extreme fasting 5 days a week of no food or calories... I do wonder if I messed up my metabolism. 
- Unable to shift weight from 82-83kg... Not too fussed as still pretty low and healthy
- Covid hits the UK in March 2020. From this point onwards I'm on and off Keto... Mainly because it was necessary, the original few months were crazy with food shortages etc. Despite this my weight stays at around 83kg
- June 2020 I have a tummy tuck and gynecomastia surgery. This was planned for a while to get rid of excess skin and the man boobs I had always had.
- Post op: bizzarely about 87kg. After 2 weeks I go back on full keto
- Steady weight gain since then, any time I come off keto for Christmas or Chinese New Year say, even the odd day or two, I put on weight. I then don't seem to be able to lose any weight.
- Current weight 97kg... In the past two years I have put 10kg back on and I'm desperate to lose it but nothing is happening.

My diet!:
- I am still on strict keto
- I restrict myself to 1500 calories a day but often is lower than this
- I fast a lot, Infact I barely eat, its usually OMAD
- I take vitamin suppliments
- I've tried all sorts, apple cider vinegar each day, microbiome pills for healthy gut, no change
- I'm active, in the gym, I play football once a week, generally walk everywhere and tend to do long walks once or twice a week (15km+). I've just got a new bike so will be using that this summer too. 
- I have tried other diets that aren't low carb, most recently I tried a standard Western diet with calorie counting alongside ADF. so I would eat 1500-1600 calories of a standard diet Inc healthy carbs, fruits and veg one day and then not eat the next. This ballooned me up to the current 97kg and I now look noticeably bigger and my clothes don't fit.

diet,"Hi,

I'm 26 years old, male. Height is 5'8""/173 cm and I currently weigh 139 lbs or about 63 kg.

I'm a triathlete, I do about 10h of cardio and about 2h of strength training each week. I'd like to cut down to about 134 pounds or 61 kg, but I'm having trouble with this because I'm struggling with hunger constantly. To lose about 0,55 lbs or 0,25 kg each week (don't want to lose more each week, too hard) I'd have to eat about 2100 kcals each day. i've not been able to hit this target for days because of that constant hunger feeling. So I always overeat this target. My diet looks like this to cut down to 61 kg:

\- Breakfast:

I mostly eat weetabix original (wheat) with skimmed milk and like an apple or so. I also really like some pudding with high protein sometimes.

\- Lunch:

Low-fat yoghurt (750g/1.65 lbs, find this quite filling because of the volume) + like 300g/,66 lbs of canned veggies. Mostly peas, beans, corn or macedoine of vegetables.

\- Dinner:

Now this is probably something I can improve, but for dinner I eat Huel Hot &amp; Savoury. About 3 scoops which comes around to about 600 kcals. 

During the day to fill up calories, I just eat lots of variaties or fruits really. And something like canned tuna to make sure I hit 2 grams of protein per kg of bodyweight. But like I said, I'm having trouble surpressing hunger which makes me overeat my goal of 2100 kcals. There are probably some foods or healthy snacks I can eat to cope with this more easily? But which ones? Any tips for this? I can probably improve my dinner aswell, since Huel isn't really whole foods so less filling I assume.",Trouble surpressing hunger during cutting phase,1648196051

35% carbs (193 grams)
30% fats (86 grams)

4 eggs
2 pieces of wheat toast with a little butter

If you want to loose weight, DONT restrict yourself from eating...it will make things worse.

Eat when you are actually hungry or need nutrition...don't constantly eat food for no reason.  
Exercise regularly, you don't need to loose all your weight and become muscular like a weightlifter, you don't have to overwhelm yourself. Go out for walks, do some other exercises like biking and such.  
Drink water but dont overhydrate...you can tell by the color of urine if you need water or dont need water.  
Lastly get in a good mood, and dont panic about things...being in a good mood helps you stay healthy.  
Yeah, its true...the better mood you are in, the healthier you can be.

Ever since May 8th of last year (2021), I've been eating just *once* a day. It is either 3 or 4 eggs, 2 burgers from Walmart, or some boneless and skinless chicken breasts. I rarely add seasoning (high blood pressure -and I actually enjoy ""bland"" food). However, I've only lost 31 lbs in about 9 or 10 months, or so. I *am not* trying to starve to lose weight. I *am* trying to ""starve"" to prepare my body for hell.... actually. Basically, I bart eat because I think I'll get no food after I die and go to hell. Strange to think about to an outsider, I know (I believe in a physical hell).

During those 10 months that I lost 50lbs without trying, I ate.just once a day and would drink about three 24oz 211 Steel Reserves a night for 3 to 5 nights week. I *did* still do my workout program, which consisted of simple calisthenics for a few sets (maxing out each set). I'd usually workout about 4 or 5 hours after waking, then eat my single meal for the day.

Nowadays, I do NOT workout (weights or calisthenics). I eat once a day. And I am a *heavy* drinker now. About 4 or 5 24oz 211's a night for 20 nights out of a month. So, drinking heavily for 2/3 of the month. No exercise.

I do know 1 drink with food becomes fat. And 3 drinks or more with NO food becomes fat. (Carbs.) I don't run, I don't do bodyweight work (for about a year now) and don't lift weights. Completely sedentary. 

Is this normal to have only lost 31lbs? Should I maybe add *some* movement to help in weight loss? I'm not *activy* trying g to lose weight, but kinda wish that almost no food would've made me at least 60lbs by now. (And yes, I do know the beer is a major factor. But I won't slack off. I'm gonna drink heavily til I die, which I expect to be soon - maybe within a year.)","Not active trying to lose weight, but barely eat and have only lost 30 lbs in 1 (one) year.

* Snack (at around 4-5pm) - half an apple  / banana.
* Meal 2 (dinner) - brown rice and dals cooked in ghee and seasoning, paneer, broccoli/carrots, and occasionally some tinned meat (dinner is my heaviest meal, because I get super hungry in the evenings)

* 10g chia or flaxseeds

* 2bananas or 1 big apple (200g)

* nuts (walnuts, hazelnut, or pecan) (10-50)
* fruits (4-5 fruits, mostly bananas or apples) every day, 
* and some sardines if I need some protein (this is not every day, maybe once a week)

2nd meal would be

* rice with lentils (green or red) or rice with beans 
* meat (eggs, chicken, fish, meat),  (about 200-300g)
* veggie mix (potatoes, carrots, green peas) or broccoli or spinach (alternate)

diet,"So yeah. I’m underweight and want to gain some weight. My target weight is about 65-70kgs 

I was born with an oesophagus issue that has led to me a)Eating slower than most people b) Food often gets stuck in my throat and I have to swallow multiple times to very uncomfortably force it down and c)Often getting really painful acid reflux when I’ve eaten a lot. So obviously this has probably had an effect on why I’m underweight 

More than that, most of the time I just can’t be bothered to eat. A lot of the time when I’m eating I’ll either get bored and want to do literally anything else or get weirdly tired and want to just ditch my meal and go sleep. Eating just takes so fucking long and I barely have time to eat two meals a day, let alone anything more than that

The only times where I ever feel any appetite at all are in the morning and after a workout, which is when I have my meals. But even then, I often get bored or tired mid meal and leave   

And on top of all this, I’m the textbook definition of an ectomorph. It takes a lot to make me put on weight, and just one day of not eating till I feel sick will make me lose it all and be back to square one.

And it’s weird because I generally enjoy eating when I’m out at a restaurant or a cafe, but as for the normal day to day eating I just can’t be bothered most of the time

I was able to get away with it when I was real young but now being 28 maybe it's catching up to me.  


I've just started a new daily routine of pushing to get those servings of vegetables in with shakes. From what I've read online the most important part is eating uncooked whole vegetables. So what I've been doing lately is having a shake of Athletic Greens(AG1) when I first wake up, then after my morning workout I make a shake that consists of water, 1-2 cups of kale, 1-2 cups of spinach, 1 cup of broccoli, then I also add 3 scoops of Subi veggie mix because it makes the smoothie taste great,  a cup of frozen berries, and a scoop of Progressive VegeGreen.  


What I am mostly wondering is if this is a good daily routine or will it still not make up for not eating many vegetables during my meals. I'm not exactly sure the number of services in those smoothies but the Subi product says 4+ servings per scoop(So 4 \* 3 = 12 services), plus a scoop of the Progressive VegeGreens, plus 3-5 cups of raw veggies. I am not sure if since I drink it, or have all that in one sitting that may be a lot of it may go to waste as well.

I also read on the Progressive VegeGreen bottle that you should consult a doctor if you use it continuously for over 12 weeks. So it made me wonder if there were issues with using those products long-term and a lot, or if it was just for people with rare conditions.

diet,"I've been vegetarian since I was fourteen. I decided to cut out meat because I didn't like supporting companies that treated their animals poorly, but more importantly, many meats (most fish and pork) make me very ill. At the time, I had no reason why I couldn't. I had no dietary restrictions and I was a healthy weight.

In the three years since, I've gained nearly 50lbs (though I've also grown five or so inches, so take that with a grain of salt). I'm currently 5'3 and consistently weighing in at 164lbs. I had a very rough time during quarantine and the eating disorders I've dealt with on and off since I was young ran rampant.

I've also learned that I have food allergies. I'm mildly allergic to wheat, cow's milk, sesame, strawberries and shrimp. I have not had an opportunity to cut those out yet, and my diet mainly consists of dairy and wheat.

I've tried to lose weight on and off for years. I've tried healthy ways and I've tried unhealthy ways. But I never lost much, two or three pounds at most.

I feel ill most days. Granted, I'm chronically ill, but I feel absolutely awful and I have to wonder if my diet is playing a large role in that. I'm constantly bloated and I'm constantly vomiting everything I've eaten. I deal with protein deficit as well.

I'm starting to think it would be better for my health and weight to begin eating meat again. I know from previous attempts that I can't digest meat properly anymore, so I would have to reintroduce it very gradually, but if that's what I need to stop feeling so bad.

I don't even care about my appearance anymore like I used to - I don't care about weight loss in that sense. I just want to have a good night's sleep again without feeling like I'm going to vomit my entire stomach up. I just want to feel better.

Would this be safe, given my current state? I clearly have a very sensitive stomach, and I already know I can't handle much meat anymore. How should I go about doing this?",I think it's time for me to consider eating meat again for the sake of my health. Thoughts?,1647221335
diet," So basically it's like this. I'm teetering on the edge of becoming overweight (according to BMI) and I'm hoping to loose some weight. I normally don't every really exercise and snack on peanut better, honey, and junk food pretty often. Me meals often are high carb, high protein, high fat, and in large portions.

I really want to loose weight, so this is what I'm trying.

1. Cutting out all carbs from breakfast and lunch, and having a small amount at dinner.
2. During breakfast and lunch, focus mainly on protien, fiber, and vitamines (basically eggs, meat, and veggies) in small-medium portions.
3. Cutting out all sugar for good (will be hard, but I NEED to go cold turkey).
4. Starting a 1 hour exercise 3 days a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) with 20 minutes of running, 20 minutes of fast walking, 20 minutes of weights.

Can someone give me an idea of what my current diet is giving me and what I still need, nutrition wise?

So the following is probably TMI but I am going to throw it out there hoping someone can help me figure out the best diet I can from these foods, and slowly work my way up to adding new dishes if necessary (it probably is. or maybe I can just take a multi-vitamin? Would hiring a nutritionist help me organize and analyze this data?)

I have food issues in that most things taste bad or put me off, so I have a limited diet of things I can tolerate, and I tend to eat the same things every day (also for convenience as I can only cook super-basic things like soups, grilled cheese sandwiches or omelets). 

If anyone can help me, I am a 35 female weighing 125 pounds, 61 inches tall. From what I've figured out, my daily calorie intake is presently 1550/day\*. 

Breakfast every day is cheerios (original version), skim milk, banana. Lunch Monday-Friday is peanut butter\*\* on white bread\*\*\*, and a side of raisins (2 boxes so 180 calories). I should probably add a fruit cup. Know any premade healthy ones I can get at the grocery store? (edit: google says I can make my own but coat it in citrus juice to preserve it over the week. But all the prep sounds like a pain, so if there are good pre-made ones at the store, let me know). \*\*\*\*

I tend to skip lunch on weekends. 

Dinner I can vary more conveniently. I either like things I can pop out of the box and pop into the oven, or make on the weekend and reheat over the workweek. I am a vegetarian (mostly). Lately, I've been heating pre-made store-bought cheese and spinach quiche in the oven, and veggie spring rolls (no sauce). I can't tell if the veggies make it healthy or if the vehicle cancels out any health benefits of the veggies. 

I completely cut out snacks such as cookies and ice cream I also enjoy. I want to work them back into my life after I lose 10-15 pounds. I also started an exercise program beginning of February and am improving slowly but surely. 

On the weekend I also sometimes make omelets with green and red peppers and onion and a side of sweet potato for the week (just butter, salt, pepper added to the potato). Other such meals/sides can be steamed broccoli and a touch of butter. I like a snack of cashews. I like mushroom barley soup (restaurant bought, convenient but expensive) and matzo ball soup (homemade, cheap but inconvenient, lol). I like a spinach-base salad with carrots, cucumbers, cabbage, and onions mixed in. Vinaigrette dressing. 

Of fruits, I like apples, banana, cantaloupe, cherries, grapes, oranges, peaches, strawberries, tangerines. I am trying to learn to like tomatoes. Right now I find them gross, but I will keep adding them to my salad as I'm told they're very healthy. 

Of veggies, I like asparagus, green beans, broccoli, red cabbage, carrot, cauliflower (when made into a pizza crust that they no longer sell at my local, so I can't eat it anymore and it is probably also an unhealthy vehicle for eating cauliflower anyway), cucumber, edamame, mushrooms, red onion, green and red pepper, sweet potato, spinach, zucchini. 

Can't think what else I eat that's healthy. 

The only meats I like are the unhealthy ones: bacon, salami, hot dog. (I've cut these out of my diet). The rest smell bad, taste bad, and feel bad on my tongue (texture issues). Ditto fish or other seafood. I wasn't kidding about food issues. 

\*I cut out the Gatorade and Fritos (which meant 300 calories less/day and removing about 80% of my sugars). 

\*\*In an effort to improve my diet I switched from Peter Pan Creamy PB to Smucker's Natural 

\*\*\*I used to eat honeywheat bread but the preservatives apparently make it just as unhealthy as white bread, so I switched back to white

diet,"\--- CONTEXT ---

I always viewed (and still do) weight loss as CICO. With this simple ""knowledge"", I one day deiced to lose weight (when I hit my highest ever weight of 103kg) and applied this ""knowledge"" by very loosely measuring how much calories I'm eating and limited that to around 500-1000 less (depending on day) than what an online calculator told me my daily intake should be. With no exercise and practically zero change in my diet (apart from volume), I went to my current weight (83kg) which I'm feeling a lot better about.

After that point, I stopped ""trying"" to diet, though I still roughly watch how much I eat, usually I don't watch at all and just eat until I'm full. I've been living like this now for around half a year or so, and am staying at my weight for the most part. Sometimes I go to 85kg (like today), and I've also dropped to as low as 79kg before (don't know if such a broad range of weight is normal, but I can go up / down by 2kg or more in a single day).

I've now ""normalized"" a weight of 83kg as the default and would like to start ""trying"" again to get to my original goal (\~73kg).

I think it will be a lot harder to lose this weight, even if it's technically less, because I limiting many calories now will take more effort than it did when I was essentially over-eating in the first place, and am thinking of incorporating some dietary choices which I want to make permanent because I believe unless it's effortless to do, I won't stick to it (because keeping to my eating times and portions is the maximum effort I can stick to when I'm trying).

\--- CURRENT DIET ---

My current diet is only water when it comes to drinking and whatever I want to eat as long as it's vegetarian. Usually consume very little sugar, because it consistently gives me pimples, but sometimes I still eat some cookies / piece of cake / etc...

On my typical day, I will skip breakfast and eat one meal when I get home. on average I'd say I eat at around 16:00 (4PM).  
This is how all my days look when I start trying again, but right now I don't stick to this regime because I'm lazy.

\--- WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR ---

I'm looking for easy things to eliminate indefinitely from my diet that don't dramatically decrease my choice of food or make me do any special work to avoid it, because of the reason mentioned above, but are extremely effective when it comes to resulting in me consuming less calories because of it.

My weight currently is considered healthy and my muscle to fat ratio is already good but I've always wanted to just try a bulk so I'm look forward to seeing my body change.

Please do point out anything worth mentioning. I'd also like to clarify I am on stimulant medication so appetite tends not to really matter so I can mange with the boring food patterns.

diet,"My usual diet before consisted of mostly crabs in form of bread or rice meals about four times and drinking about 250ml milk twice a day at separate times. I have felt lethargic throughout the day for many years.

My father has diabetes type 2 for many years now and I feel really sad to see a strong man get so weak. I didn't want to get it and as I have same diet as his so I decided to change it.

After learning about healthy eating I saw that I needed more fats, proteins and fibres in my diet.

So back in January I changed my diet, I started taking an orange every morning with breakfast which made me full quicker, making me eat less bread. I also ate some sprouts and other fruits with each meal to increase my fibre intake.

I felt a bit drained a day or 2 so I added more protein (maybe it wasn't a lot but I was just beginning to change). And after the third day I started feeling the changes.

- LESS FREQUENT HUNGER (I used to get hungry and feeling lightheaded as soon as I got hungry.)

- EXTREMELY ENERGETIC ( I had never felt this energetic before for 8 years since I was a young kid! )

- NO MORE LIGHTHEADED OR LETHARGIC ( I became extremely productive than before)

BUT SADLY IT FINALLY CAME TO AN END AFTER 20 DAYS

I was hungry one evening and my mom was cooking food, it took around 30-40 minutes of being hungry, but still completely energetic no problem.

That meal was mostly carbs, I ate it and in about 15 minutes all of my energy throughout the month came crashing down. I felt really lightheaded and all energy went away. It was really drastic change in just 2 hours. My parents told me that I was not eating enough carbs in the day and that's why it happened. My weight was constant throughout this new diet.

Similar events kept on happening after a few day but with less severity.

I am now back to my old diet but with more carbs.

It feels really bad now, I feel hungry really quickly, like every 2-3 hours. Even feeling hungry when I eat a lot. Feeling wierd when hungry I have to eat carbs quickly or else I will get lightheaded.

I don't know how to bounce back. I feel scared to change my diet after what happened. 

I have gained a lot of fat around my stomach in these 1-2 months. I am fatter than before 😭.

TLDR, I tried to eat healthy and it backfired hard and I dont know why. I don't know what to do now. I feel like shit all day.

I got checked with my doc for diabetes and other deficiency and the tests came out fine. My weight was constant throughout this. I have also added whey protein to meet my protein requirements as per doc's advice ( it has been 4-5 days of 30g extra protein ).

Does anyone else have this problem? I lost a lot of weight over the pandemic due to unhealthy living and I’m now what you’d call “skinny fat” and trying to get my muscle tone back.

I have a voracious appetite although I am very skinny and I have to eat a lot to not feel hungry.

How bad would it be if 3/7 days a week all I ate was basically just rice? Maybe a banana and some peanut butter in the morning, but basically no veg/fruit and no fish/meat for lunch or dinner. Maybe throw on a bit of sesame oil and soy sauce for the rice to go down

My spending would be cut nearly 40% and it would also be far easier for me, i.e. don't have to cook meals everyday during the weak.

I just spend so much on avacado and brocolli and salmon and the like and eating it everyday, sometimes I wonder whether it is really that necessary.I shop at cheap places, Aldi and Lidl, it still just all adds up. Even garden peas become expensive with how much I eat.

I recently cut out drinking and cut back heavily on meat... at first I was constipated for a few days, so I added a daily apple.... and now I am taking absolutely gargantuan movements in the bathroom. Like it reminds me of that episode of South Park where Randy breaks the world record.... I was someone who went like 3-5 times a day in medium sized amounts that were kinda.... haphazard. Shotgun blast style.... And now they're these absolutely massive single solid pieces. I took one so big I took a photo of it, and then the next day I took one twice as big. I'm used to pinching stuff off or straining or going a bit too frequently, etc. Basically extremely inconsistent and a lot of effort involved... and suddenly I am very regular and it all basically takes care of itself. They're much larger, they came out in basically one piece and that piece is absolutely massive but then I'm done and clean up isn't nearly as labor intensive as before. Much more of a clean and simple break.

I know that's a lot of potentially gross detail... But I am genuinely curious because I'm somewhat obsessive compulsive and only recently have I adopted a truly balanced diet where I have some leafy greens, a very modest amount of animal protein and a proportionate serving of fruit and I basically don't gorge myself or snack, I'm not consuming alcohol, I'm not eating tons of cookies or tons of animal meat, etc.... I used to just eat massive amounts of chicken and tons of Oreos or Chocolate Chip Cookies and then I'd have a few drinks every night and my bathroom rhythm was... frequent and disorganized, lets say.

diet,"Hello. I'm a 20 year old female with a BMI of almost 40. I had a successful weightloss journey beforehand - I had lost about 30 kilos / about 66lbs. I think it's important to note this because I know weightloss is possible..
However, I have an eating disorder. Trigger warning for anybody who may get hurt :( I have binge eating disorder and lately not only did I completely regain all of the weight, I am so scared to weigh myself because I wholeheartedly believe I now weigh more.

I started losing weight by my own good will (as previously my mother was forcing weightloss on me) at the age of 14 after my visit to the hospital when I was told I weighed 120 kilos and I had insulin resistance (pre-diabetes for diabetes type 2). Ever since then I dropped all the way to 79 kilogrammes and I was happier than ever. Of course, all of this happened for many years and only last year I nailed this goal. Sadly, I had some severe family disruptions and my BED has been triggered ever since.

I lost my way, so to say. I know the basics of calorie counting and I plan on again following a stricter regime. My question is: which are the MOST NUTRITIONALLY NEEDED foods? As a result of my binges consisting mainly of very sugary very carbohydrate-based meals I am experiencing vitamin deficiencies and at this point fresh fruit and vegetables are a must. I really want to cook for myself, too, since I finally left home. What are some recipes that I can follow which are low in calories? As I am a Slavic person our kitchen consists of mainly using potatoes and starchy foods, though there are some lovely recipes. I made lentils for the first time, too! It was delicious and I enjoyed it. Of course, I experimented with spinach and rice, though I suppose using brown rice would be a good idea?

I genuinely appreciate your time to read through this and I hope you have an amazing day!",How can I restart my journey?,1646310191

Training i do now (diet is below the exercising i do) :

I go to gym 5 days a week. 

Monday : Upper body biceps triceps + chest exercises.

Tuesday : rest

Wednesday : leg day

Thursday : back day

Friday : chest day

Saturday : Upper body biceps triceps 

Sunday : rest  


I swim pool or jogging for 30min - 1hour everyday and burn 500 calories. I also do 8 sets everyday of different types of push ups, i dont count reps i just do till failure.

&amp;#x200B;

For my diet right now :

In calories i eat a little surplus than my BMR of 1760, i eat 1900 calories a day, and everyday i do jogging or swimming pool to have a little deficit of around 360 - 400 deficit, i try to reach 2.2x gram per weight kilo of protein a day (i weight 68kg so 150g of protein).  


I do intermittent fasting from 6 - 7pm to 12am the next day

For the 12am meal (idk the word in english) i eat meal with a lot of protein, eggs, ham trenche with no fat, chicken, sardines, sometimes with a little cheese, 2 trenche of complete bread. I also like to eat a salad or a fruit if i dont feel full. Usually 500 - 600 calories

&amp;#x200B;

For the dinner i live at my parents house and for dinner we eat at 5pm, also some days in the week they like to eat junk food (usually 3 days), but the rest we eat, pasta, rice, vegetables. I always calculate the calories when we eat junk food and for me it is usually around 800 - 1000, 300 - 500 the healthy meal days.  


After dinner :  
If i ate junk food with a lot of protein (like burger or fried chicken) i eat a fruit, (usually a mango mixed) and black chocolate square to fill the 1900 calories only if they are not already filled, my protein objective is usually attained these days.

If i ate junk food with less protein (like pizza or nachos), i try to eat the least while still profiting these days, and ill just make myself a protein shake to reach my protein objective + a fruit if i still didn't reach 1900 calories yet.  


If i ate healthy, ill make myself some meat again, with a protein shake, + a fruit if i still didn't reach 1900 calories.

diet,"I don't remember ever having this reaction before, but over the last couple of days I noticed that I would feel unusually energized (almost to the point of giddiness) after eating organ meat.  Assuming this could be linked to a nutrient deficiency, what specific nutrient(s) might I be missing in my diet?

Considerations:

* I don't get the craving beforehand, only during and after eating organ meat.  I keep thinking about having more, and need to consciously stop myself from wolfing down an entire serving.  The cravings seem to be getting weaker over time though, as I've been consistently eating them recently.
* I take Vitamin D semi-regularly and never felt energized afterwards, so I don't think it's related to the change in season and amount of sunlight.
* I've been previously prescribed iron tablets for minor anemia, but since a couple years ago my doctor has indicated that I don't need to take them anymore.  While I've felt less tired after taking the tablets, I don't ever recall feeling the level of energy that I'm feeling now after eating organ meat just once or twice.  I also don't get the same energetic reaction after having spinach, fish, eggs, or even caffeine (though sometimes I do crave those foods).  Bloodwork doesn't show an iron deficiency?
* The one thing that has come remotely close to raised energy levels is Coenzyme Q-10 supplements, which are known to have this effect and I've only taken them twice before--I don't have a craving for any supplements.
* I've never had pica, I'm not pregnant, and I'm way past puberty.
* The specific organ meat is pork heart, which I've never had before.  There aren't any special occasions or memories associated with it, I just happened to try it one day.  I've had liver, but don't like the taste and never have a craving for it.
* There's nothing special about the taste or method of cooking, if anything it cooked and tasted like any other cut of pork meat/muscle (frankly, it's more a muscle than organ) so I don't think it's simply the novelty of it.  I don't have such strong cravings for any other cut of pork or meat.
* There hasn't been any change in my usual activity, stress, or hunger levels; I've had trouble sleeping, but this isn't anything new either.  I don't think it's really related to regulatory cycles as there hasn't been any drastic change in my daily schedule?

I've been trying to eat more healthy over the years to curb anxiety and low mood, so if I could pin down what it is that's helping me now then that could be a life-changer. ^(Or maybe my body just decided to randomly go through a vampire phase. /s)","Sudden craving, nutrient deficiency?",1646197229

Finally decided it was time to lose weight, and it came off pretty quick.

I track my calories pretty much on point, I don't leave anything out whatsoever and weigh everything. 

I'm currently eating at about 1450 calories daily right now at 178lbs (Height: 5'11, Age: 21) and I can't seem to lose the weight. Every online BMR calculator and equation I use easily shows 1450 should be a pretty big deficit.

diet,"I am conflicted about intuitive eating. I am new to it. Doesn't it allow for over eating? If I eat whenever I am hungry I would always be eating. Also I think that people have different philosophies on why to eat healthy. Someone might want to eat better to feel good. Others want to get in shape. Intuitive eating seems to say that all bodies are good. Which I agree. But I have been overweight my entire life. I have never been on a plane or a Rollercoaster or a slide. My seat belt doesn't reach in my car. I'm tired of never fitting in things. Or getting winded from going up a flight of stairs or get sweaty from just sitting in my bed. 

I also think some people eat healthy for longevity. Like their only goal is to eat as healthy as possible as perfectly as possible. They say you can eat cake or chips and stuff like that once and a while and your health will still be fine. But you can still make the argument that on average a person who never eats sugar , candy, sweets, juice, soda, chips, and fast food will probably have at least slightly higher chances of living longer than someone who does eat those things even if the're eating them in moderation as part of a well rounded eating lifestyle(diet). Wouldn't eating a healthy diet mean eating as healthy as possible as often and as perfectly as possible? Isn't that the point? Eat veggies and fruits and nuts and grains and fish so you give your self the chance to live as long of a life as possible. Is having this goal of eating healthy to 100% maximize life span a healthy reason to eat healthy? 

A lot of people I follow for nutrition advice are always advocating for the best healthy option possible at all times. The buddhists do not eat for pleasure, but then again they don't aim for healthy either. They eat whatever is available. I am 23 years old and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at 19. I am always worrying about my life expectancy. My doctors can't give me an estimate of my life expectancy because there isn't a lot of data on young type 2 diabetics in long term outcomes. I am worried that no matter what I do health wise, I won't make it to normal life expectancy of 80 or that my quality of life will be really bad as I get into middle age. 

Every one in my family dies by the time they reach 63. My diabetic uncle just died at 58 and he had his legs cut off 25 years ago. The doctor I had made me feel neglected and unheard. I go to a clinic for old people because all the people there are elderly people who are diabetic. There's nobody my age. When I walked in my doctor told me how I am going to go blind and lose my legs. She gave me at 19 the same dietary advice she gives to her 80 year old diabetic patients. I am not 80. And I cannot eat like an 80 year old. I'm still young. My friends want cheesecake factory and I have to ask for the seniors menu because it's in the dietary guidelines the doctor gave me. They're eating cheesecake at cheesecake factory and pasta too. I'm eating grilled chicken and steamed veggies with apple sauce. AND NO CHEESECAKE! I am so lost and don't know what to do. I don't want to die young. I want to see my friends when I am older and I just don't know if it's possible even if I eat as healthy as possible.",Intuitive eating and diabetes.,1645658526

During fasting, I only drink plain tea and espresso shots.

- There's a period after the hunger pangs where I'm no longer hungry. Is that when autophagy starts?
- How should I tide across these short depressive mood swings?
- I read something about sugar spikes with regards to fasting. Should I have a little snack then before resuming normal meals? I'm not very keen on cooking (yet) so I'm keeping not considering dieting and will only look into it if it has a lot of benefits/solve my problems.

diet,"Hey guys. I started dieting last week. I am a 230 pound male and I’m 23. 

The best way for me to loose weight is to limit my calories to around 1000-1500 a day while also going to the gym a few times a week. 

It probably isn’t the healthiest thing but I am able to loose weight fast this way. 

I noticed that while I’m just sitting down my heart rate dips to 55-65.  And sleeping it can go 45-55. 

Before dieting I was around 70-80sitting down. 

Is this because of me consuming way less calories? Wondering if anyone has any idea or if they had a similar experience while cutting calories.

I knew I couldn't completely quit all the food that I've been eating my entire life cold turkey. Trying to change something completely in one day when you've been doing it your whole life is to me, impossible and a waste of time. Instead I had decided to think of a strategy and I was wondering if anyone could give me feedback on if its a good idea!

What I intend to do is still eat the food I normally do, but make minimal changes at the start of the transition. I would try to eat at least one type of fruit or vegetable at the end of the day. I'm doing that for a couple weeks to help me get used to fruits and veggies in my diet. It's worked in a sense as I feel a lot more comfortable now eating it at the end of the day! However the future is what I'm wondering about, perhaps I should do the same but just increase the amount of fruits and vegetables I eat. Or maybe even start considering substituting foods already present in my diet with healthier options.

Anyways, please let me know if you think there should be something different done, or if I'm just doing it wrong, Thanks!",Feedback on strategy for transitioning to healthier food!,1645101344

I will try to keep it short and on point.

I am a woman. So I “naturally” fluctuating between nice skinny and skinny fat. Every attempt to gain weight or get fitter is counter productive.

Whenever I just eat more I get more out of shape than when I eat very little. My legs get SKINNIER when I eat! Yes skinnier. My belly gets fatter, but that wouldn’t be a problem if my legs were not getting skinnier at the same time. Basically when I eat more (on “balanced diet”) I look more insulin resistant. When I eat less I have a skinny hourglass figure. 

Out of desperation, this summer I did fruiterian with ocasional low fat vegan and I actually kept hour glass shape. Still skinny but high carb resulted in proportionate figure. Some bottom weight and flat stomach.

After 6 months now I introduced meat and my legs and my butt are getting skinnier. My belly is getting chubby and I look shapeless. 
Its very obvious that eating meat is making me more INSUIN RESISTANT I tried just meat with low carb and meat with balanced carb. Result is worse when I eat just meat, but close in both cases. (High quality carbs, no junk). In general I eat almost 0% junk and I prepare all my own food. 

My suspicion was: high fat induced insulin resistance from meat, but again ocasional vegan dish with oil didn’t previously have the same effect as meat. And I cook meat with no oil. 

Second idea is high uric acid form purines in meat? Uric acid can lead to insulin resistance. 

Please if you have any idea, god bless you! But please don’t tell me to work out, this is an attempt to hack my diet without combing any other factors. 

I tried adding more fiber/resistant starch to be the same level as when I was fruiterian/vegan no success.

I’m not sure if counting calories has turned into a problem for me. I count absolutely everything I eat/drink and log it into myfitnesspal, and if it doesn’t have a nutrition label telling me how many calories is in it, I don’t eat it, including what my mom makes.

I would say i’m at a healthy weight now but I still eat a tiny bit under maintenance and keep tracking every single thing on myfitnesspal because I am afraid of gaining it all back. Right now I’m trying to build muscle eating at this amount, rather than losing fat.

Recently i’ve been having stomach issues as well (gassy, bloating, constipation) I guess that it’s because of me eating very high protein with high volume meals without fat in it.

I worry that everything I said it turning into a problem, and I want to go back to when I just ate what my mom cooked for me but i’m afraid of gaining weight back.

diet,"Title is an understatement, I am M(39) and a week ago I was 425 lbs. I've known for a very long time I needed some radical life changes, I don't want to get into that here.  After a year of researching, planning and just plain procrastinating, I went on a whole food vegan diet about a week ago.  

So far I have not had many problems with hunger or cravings, I did tell myself that if I was hungry, I would eat something, though it would only be unprocessed natural foods.  For example I was hungry last night so I had about a half cup of unsalted almonds.  All in all I have been pleasantly surprised how easy it has been so far. 

My diet consists of a chickpeas (hummus and other various forms), spinach, sweet potatoes, beets, edamame, black beans, quinoa, fruits such as bananas, strawberries, blueberries, clementines.  I also use peanut butter, almond butter with almond milk for smoothies. Other various nuts, legumes and seeds too.  Very little bread, wheat when I do. For dessert before bed I'll have a cup of coconut milk yogurt with about a half cup of thawed blueberries on occasion. This is not all inclusive and I will probably slowly branch out but you get the idea.

An example of a typical dinner, last night I made chana masala, one of my favorite indian dishes.  I had a cup of that with a cup of quinoa. 

It is a very restrictive diet, but again, I haven't had much problems with hunger or cravings.  I am aiming for about 1800 calories a day, but it probably sometimes creeps to 2000.

I expected to lose a lot of water weight at first, I lost about 10 lbs in 2 days. But from what I know this diet, about a 1000 calorie deficit from my BMR, should take off about 2 lbs a week, which is what I want.  However this is so far not what I'm seeing.  After the initial 10 lbs, I have consistently lost about 0.5 to 1 lb a day. I'm worried that could be problematic and unhealthy.  Should I just increase portion size?  Even if I'm full which I often am?  Or is this still just shedding water weight?

Another surprising thing, sorry kinda gross, I expected to be pooping more, but I'm actually pooping less, once a day.  I do not feel constipated at all, there just seems to not be a lot in there.

Also, there are tons of advice online on what supplements to take on this diet.  I started taking b12 and D3 supplements, I'm not sure if I need to add calcium, iron, and Omega3 to it.

With my diet I am not very strict about it and didn't even realize I was dieting at first. I just started restricting my meals to only dinner and a snack or two throughout the day. My father usually makes very nutritious meals that have a good mix of vegetables, proteins, and grains in them. And I eat other foods to hit other nutritional areas throughout the day. One day a week, normally Saturday or Sunday, I allow myself to eat lunch and dinner and as many snacks as I feel like throughout the day, it gets rid of most feelings of hunger throughout the week and makes sure I'm not at an unhealthy level of dieting, I don't want to develop an eating disorder or something. 

Before this diet I had lunch, dinner, and multiple very unhealthy snacks throughout the day and never exercised much at all. I still don't exercise much, but I'm working on that. Point is, I was super unhealthy and since I started this diet I have felt cleaner and healthier and lighter. And when I eat those same unhealthy chips, microwaved foods, and baked goods at the same level I used to, I just feel gross.

Breakfast: Overnight oats w/ various fruit topping – 200 calories

Lunch: Carb balance burrito – 250 calories

Dinner: Chicken breast w/ jasmine rice and broccoli – 470 calories

diet,"TL;DR - Are there any articles linking first shift work to weight gain? There are plenty that link 3rd shift work to weight gain, but my personal experience has been polar opposite. I lose weight on 3rd shift and gain *massive* amounts on 1st shift. 



I am currently knocking on the door of morbidly obese. I'm 6'4 and topping the scales at an absolutely embarrassing and disgusting 280 pounds. I've developed weight induced sleep apnea, but I cannot use a CPAP. I've tried it and the damn thing leaves me choking at night. 




I have worked a variety of shifts over the years. In my 14 years of being full time in the work force, I have spent 10 of those years working night shift. Of my 10 years on night shift, 9 of those years were as a bus driver, in a very sedentary role. I worked 1st shift for the company one year, and 2nd shift for the company another year, for 11 years total (I quit mid year my final year). In my 11 years with the company, my body weight went from 180 at the start to 220 at the end. So all told I gained 40 pounds in 10 years. The majority of the weight gain occurred the years I worked 1st and 2nd shift.





I thought this was a coincidence, so when I left being a bus driver and became a mechanic, I got a job working for a small shop on 1st shift. I worked there 10 months from 2019 to 2020. In those 10 months I gained another 40 pounds ballooning up to 260 and starting to not fit in my work uniforms anymore.





I was forced out the door as a mechanic during Covid. I got a job working at a trucking company as a forklift driver and worked there for a year. Six months as a forklift driver, 6 months as a yard truck driver (jockey, hostler, etc). The six months I was a forklift driver, I worked a variety of second shift hours (4 pm to 2 am, 1 pm to 10 pm, etc). I noticed I started losing weight. I dropped about 10 pounds to 250 or so within the first couple months. Then I switched to yard hostler. This wasn't a hugely physical job, but there was some moderate walking. It was also 3rd shift. I came in at 830 pm and worked until 6 am 5 days a week. Between having coworkers who refused to help me and having to work these horrid hours, I decided to quit and go into IT, have an office job, 40 hour work weeks, etc. My last day as a hostler I weighed myself, and I was 235 pounds. That was mid August 2021. I have been working first shift now since September 2021 in a IT help desk role, and in 5 months I have gained *FIFTY* pounds. 






I look and feel horrible. I have knee, ankle, and hip pain from years of marching band which is being severely aggravated. I have neck pain, lower back pain, and my sleep apnea is getting worse (judging by how often I wake to pee and how I have a sore throat daily from snoring). 





My diet hasn't changed tremendously over the past 14 or so years. I eat the same foods. I have lost my sources of *any* type of physical activity however. Up until 2016 I was a pretty hard core line dancer. There was a bar locally that had dancing 4 nights a week, and depending on my work schedule I could make 2 or 4 nights. That bar closed in 2016 and there have been a few attempts to reopen a dance bar in town, but they have all mostly failed. My only options for line dancing are 60-100 miles away, not really doable on a regular basis. My other physical activity of choice was all-age drum and bugle corps (think competitive marching band for adults). I participated in various programs at various intensity levels from 2010-2019. I walked away from the activity after 2019 because I no longer found local ensembles that had the environment I was looking for. The closest competitive group that meets my interests is almost 1000 miles away. That is not at all doable when rehearsals are every weekend. 







I hate traditional exercise. Going to a gym, push ups, running. I hate it all. People get an endorphin rush, I just get a rush of depression and self hatred. One friend suggested I try and find a workout partner. I don't know how to do that, so that's out of the question.","Lots of articles about night shift weight gain, but none about day shift weight gain.",1644501627

I am working 6 days, all day from 10-9pm. So I would like to add a bit of exercise to my routine but it’s going to be hard. I have an office job, so don’t get much exercise at all. 
I was wondering would it make a difference, if I do 15-30 mins everyday? Just like follow different YouTube videos?

As for my diet, I tend to skip breakfast, wait out til 4-5 pm to eat and just drink coffee and have a snack or two and three come home and have dinner. I know that needs to change. 

For starters, I know I must increase my water in take
My plan was to have some sort of protein for breakfast and a carb of choice (boiled eggs and bagel) as it’s quick and do easy

For lunch to have something similar (portion of rice, protein, and serving of vegetable) 

As for snacking, I’ll switch to having carrots, yogurt, apple sauce. Just something healthier and Not processed

Lastly for dinner, I was thinking to stick to light weight options, so maybe a salad or steamed veggies. 

Along with this, I was thinking to keep my calories at around 1400 a day.

**📷**Every day, people all over the world are struggling to lose weight and prevent obesity.Weight loss tips are the best way to slim down. Here are some of the most effective ones that you should know about. 

Tips for losing weight:

💟Stop eating before you're full, eat only until your body says it's full

Despite what dietitians, personal trainers and food manufacturers might say, our bodies are not actually ""full"" when we are satisfied. In fact, our stomachs can stretch to accommodate food up to 12-16 ounces.            [https://weightbroken.blogspot.com/2022/01/a-guide-to-weight-loss-tips-and-tricks.html](https://weightbroken.blogspot.com/2022/01/a-guide-to-weight-loss-tips-and-tricks.html)

💟Eat more vegetables and fruits

Organic produce is not only good for your body, it can also help your mind. Fruits and vegetables contain a variety of nutrients that help to boost brain health. As people age, their ability to digest food properly becomes more difficult which means that nearly all nutrients are lost if the food is not eaten raw. This can lead to serious problems such as headaches and dizziness. They can be prevented by eating a healthy breakfast.",A GUIDE TO WEIGHT LOSS TIPS AND TRICKS TO SLIM DOWN,1644043848

So I’ve had a drink or three every night for the last 2 years and put on quite a bit.

Meats taste like rotten meat/sewage. Peanut butter tastes and smells like a strong chemical. Prepared/washed lettuce, Sprite, and ice cream taste like someone sprayed perfume in my mouth. Bread has a moldy bad taste and smell. Onions and garlic are pure death and most items have onions and garlic: spaghetti sauce, pizza, frozen items. The worst part is that it is constantly changing. Something that was safe to eat last week is now bad. The first day I realized I mostly ate Hershey kisses and now those are bad. Salty things are super salty. Most fruits and veggies are super bitter. And sweet things are just super sweet. Everything else is just bland. I haven’t felt that satisfied feeling since this has started. Some days I just snack and snack, or take a bite and spit out because Im just trying to find anything that will give that satisfied sensation. 

So, I’ve mostly eaten sweet things and carbs. It’s taking a toll on me. I feel like crap constantly.

Maybe I should say lifestyle because I’m not trying to lose weight. I know some people do Keto but it seems to be a way to make your body starve itself.

I started with taking vitamins, in particular vitamin D since a lot of people in my cold climate are deficient in it. I forced myself to start eating lots of nuts, yogurt, and veggies. Making a smoothie out of fruits and veggies was helpful in consuming them. I started eating things I never ate before. The nuts in particular have been very filling and give me a lot of energy.

I used to be at 15% bf and had about 3000 BMR before covid, then I went into depression due to lack of socialization and got to 33% bf and BMR of 1500

**Current Diet and Workout** \- I currently do a 2.5 hr workout 5/6 days a week, spending 1000ish kcal and eating 1700/1750 kcal with 165g protein, 40-50g fat and rest carbs. I also watch my vitamin intake and have done blood tests to confirm that I am not deficient in any vitamins or minerals.

**Problem** \- However, my BMR is still VERY low, 1697 kcal. How do I go about increasing my BMR?

I am going to uni in a month and would like to drink and eat like students do and not worry about my BMR.

**Ideal goal** \- Ideally I would love to be back at 17.5% bfp by end of Feb or Mid-march

lose 6.2kg fat. 14kg - 6.2kg = 7.8kg fat remaining.

diet,"Like the title said, my doctor wants to see my cholesterol and liver numbers look better in a couple of months, however he wasn’t very clear on what I should do. I’ve been eating pretty poorly since early 2020 when I tore my ACL and lost motivation at the gym for obvious reasons. I’m definitely ready to eat more whole foods, fiber, and healthy fats, while cutting out the junk food. 

With that being said, I tend to go overboard and assume I need to go to the extremes so I was curious about generally how much of a diet change is needed. I’ll be skipping out on the chicken strip sandwiches and Taco Bell for the most part, but is this the type of diet where I’ll not be able to eat wings or the occasional burger maybe a couple times a month?

diet,"Hi everyone!

My question is related to the title, but it has some other parts that I'll add onto here.

Essentially, I've been making a conscious decision to cut down on my calorie intake, especially in things that have become a habit for me. For example, cutting down to half a can of coke rather than a full one everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this, I'm not a big eater. I'll have anywhere between 1-2 meals a day, on some days I just don't. If I'm having 2 meals or more, I don't really mind counting calories because I will assume I've reached/exceeded my daily advised calorie intake (around 1700), but my norm is less than this. Significantly so if I'm just having a coffee or half a coke throughout the entire day. (Worth noting that this isn't me ""dieting"", my eating habits have always been like this.) 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this: Even though I'm consuming something high in calories like a coke, but I'm not really having anything that has significant calories throughout the day (so that by the end of the day my calorie intake is less then 800 at most), should I expect to see a change in my weight? Is this how calories work or am I just grievously misunderstanding the whole thing?

First I started to only buy local fresh foods. I am from Germany and that means no tropical fruit, no vegetables from Spain, Italy. Only stuff that grows here. Same for meat, dairy. So I started to eat very seasonal: no tomatoes or bell peppers but much kale in winter for example. You get the idea. 

A while ago I adapted a ""vegan with exceptions"" diet how I call it. Means I will eat no animal products besides cheese which I simply love too much. So at this point I ate a ""vegan + cheese, local, seasonal, diet"". This led to a pretty nice weight loss as well.

Unfortunately I got some trouble with allergies and urticaria a while ago. My doctor and I searched for triggers and it turned out that I was a little sensitive to soy products and heavily processed food like sauces or ready made meals or vegan dairy/meat alternatives and also should consume nuts in very small amounts only.

I really started to struggle to get all my nutrients, especially protein, omega but also several other vitamins now since the combination of local only, almost vegan and hypoallergic diet restricts what I can eat a lot.

She has a history of disordered eating, so the goal for now is to get her to a healthy 2200 kcal daily and return her metabolism up to normal before we even start worrying about her losing weight. It's vital that she gets roughly the same number of calories each day without ups and downs and it's really hard to do without a plan.

What I'm looking for is a website that offers recipes for every meal for a week, ideally combined in such a way that no perishables get left at the end of the plan. I might even pay for service like this, if it's reasonably priced (but no more than few dolars).

Basically, trying to compose a meal plan for each week and to calculate calories for every meal and try to minimize the food waste all at the same time is well above what I have strengths and time to do. I'd just rather look up what other people came up with.

Due to covids consequences my taste and smell are completely broken for almost a year now. Almost everything makes me gag, barely able to tolerate some smells. I pretty much gave up hope on ever regaining it, dealing with lots of depressions etc.

Anyway long story short: I can only tolerate to eat Oatmeal as breakfast and for dinner pasta with mayonaise (zero) with tiny chunks of ham to add some texture. Anything meat related tastes horrible, hence only tiny pieces and a little bit. I am attempting to find more tolerable foods as I go about my life, but it is not an easy task. It kinda sucks buying and having to throw away food as you can imagine.

Can any experts tell me what this specific diet does to my body and how bad it could potentially be long term?

PS: If anyone beat the broken taste/smell from covid in the past, I would love to hear how you did it.

diet," TL;DR: what are your best health tips and what is the best way to continue learning about health, without drowning in content farms?

I'm interested in changing my diet (not that it's anything particularly bad right now) as I've been hearing/reading a lot about how consuming lots of grains (maybe I really only mean baked goods here) and sugar are detrimental to long term health. I know of a number of people who have converted to either Keto or a Carnivore diet, which I am considering. I also know a number of people who are vegetarian/vegan, and I'm not sure which is healthier (although presumably the latter is better for the environment). However, I've read papers talking about how glucose/fructose are large contributing factors for diabetes: I'm not sure about how much fruit I really ought to be consuming at all.

Generally, I'd like to drastically reduce my intake of sugar, processed foods (e.g. preservatives, artificially high sodium meals, etc.), and high fructose syrups, as clearly these are relatively new food groups with no established studies on the longer term health effects and I'd rather not run that experiment on my body.

Following a deeper rabbit hole, I know many people who say that the ""Gov Food Plate"" / food pyramid ideas are all pushed by ""Big Agriculture"", similar to how ethanol is mixed with gasoline at most gas stations. Or for instance, I frequently hear people in the US wonder how people in 3rd world countries survive without braces or wisdom teeth removal, but I believe it's been established that people in those countries don't have major teeth issues to begin with, as crooked teeth and painful wisdom teeth are symptoms of having a smaller jaw, which is believed to be caused by eating soft mushed food as children instead of having to chew and develop.

While I'm willing to read papers related to these issues, there are a few big issues I was hoping for tips on ameliorating, namely 1) having limited time to read 2) knowing who is reputable and who is not and 3) knowing what research is reputable (e.g. is a study with less than say 100 participants meaningful at all, and if they didn't use randomized control trials then are the results really objective?). And that's to say nothing of multiple studies having contradictory results.

Basically it includes calorie counting (1800/day), no highly processed foods (white bread, fried food, simple sugars, etc), high protein, frequent cardio and lifting as well. I really enjoy this diet. I feel great, and I lose two pounds or slightly more each week. I would like to lose another 25 pounds or so to bring me closer to 15% body fat, while also maintaining as much muscle as possible.

Here is the thing: normal calorie counting with lifting and cardio also works for me without all the other food restrictions (the no white bread/fried food and whatnot). I still lose weight just counting 1800 calories a day. The reason I want to switch between the stricter diet and simple calorie counting is because it's gonna take me a while to lose these next 25 pounds, and I am getting a bit tired of the foods I'm allowed to eat. I'm a full time graduate student with a part time job, so cooking elaborate meals just isn't for me (I also use my uni's dining hall every day, and it is quite hard to adhere to the strict diet depending on the menu that day). I know the stricter diet is healthier overall but honestly I lose some motivation to continue when I am just so tired of eating the same foods. So I thought maybe for one week every month I will continue the calorie counting but allow myself to eat some other things.

My question is: Are there any consequences I should expect from something like this? Could it significantly stall my weight loss?

I used to struggle with an eating disorder and I can go for a while without eating but I’ve grown out of those thought patterns and I try to eat at least twice a day.

Breakfast - Greek yogurt or protein shake. Sometimes just a sweet latte.
Lunch - I work an intense job and some days don’t have time for lunch. The days that I do have time for lunch I eat between 11-1pm just depends when I don’t have a meeting. I get lunch at work so it’s usually either a salad from the salad bar (high protein I’m vegetarian) or some carb with a little protein (rice and lentils, noodles with tofu, whatever’s on the menu)
Dinner - If I didn’t eat lunch then I’m able to eat a small dinner and go to sleep feeling full. If I did eat lunch, then I’m way too full to eat anything for dinner, usually ends up being some crackers &amp; vegan queso or something like that

I’m definitely not eating as many calories as I should but I maintain my weight since I’m not working out either and I work a desk job.

I’m not eating like huge portions or anything for lunch, sometimes maybe the salad if I put a lot of black beans or edamame but as a vegan protein is what keeps me full

However I currently would say I’m eating less than 1000 calories a day. Like 120-160 for breakfast, 300-500 for lunch if I eat lunch, and then probably 300-500 for dinner

Yesterday I forgot my yogurt and had no time for lunch so I got home and had a bean burrito and cheesy fiesta potato from Taco Bell for dinner around 8:40 (was exhausted after working 7-7, had to run errands, got home late) And then today I wasn’t hungry till 1pm so I had a salad (quinoa, corn, black beans, edamame, onions, carrots, a few sesame sticks, with a little dressing) and now I’m beyond full.

diet,"Hi everybody,
I am one of those people who puts on a lot of weight then I’m able to lose that weight pretty quickly. Not healthy but I’ve done this many times losing/gaining 60+ pounds. That is not my problem. The easy solution there is to maintain a healthy diet once I have lost weight. 

Why I am frustrated is I am not currently losing weight at the rate I have always lost in the past. My macros are all solid, under 1800 cal, low fat and carbs, high protein. I drink a barrel of  water daily and track everything that enters my mouth hole. I do cardio every other day and strength training every other day with the occasional day off.. I go very hard at the gym. I think I look like a crazy person when I’m on the elliptical because people stare at me with frightened looks as they walk by. 😂

Now I do have one of them fancy scales, and even though my weight loss has been minimal, my body fat has dropped 3% and my muscle mass has increased 3%.  Do these  cancel one another out indicating I am not losing weight? I am confused here, typically with my system I burn off 3-4 a week easily, I am going to week 4 with 4 lbs lost. I know that sounds ok but it’s way under my typical loss gains. My macros are configured for a 2.5 lb weekly loss and like I said with my regimen I typically get more.

Oh I am also on a cleanse which is disgusting but I always start a diet on one.  In the past this has radically increased weight loss.

diet,"To clarify, I'm not seeking med advice on this but just seeing if anyone else has experienced something similar. I have a high protein diet, low carb (not no carb). I did Keto for a short time maybe a year ago but couldn't entirely restrict my carb intake successfully for long, so now it's just low carb. Maybe a piece or two of bread a day and if I eat ice cream, there's some cookie dough pieces in there or whatever. But predominantly I've been consuming lots of protein, both in plant and animal form. Maybe 40% of my diet is whole foods. So it is a lot better than it used to be for sure. But strangely enough, lately when I buy fruits and vegetables and eat them on their own, it feels like a challenge to eat them. I have to force myself to eat them. It's almost like I feel an aversion to them or like they do not satisfy me so when eating them, the flavor just feels almost repulsive.

Not in an extreme way but just like ""ehh, why am I eating this when I don't want to?"" kind of a feeling. It's strange and at first it was just whole foods like cantaloupe that I just bought kind of repulsed me with the texture (and I have always loved cantaloupe) and a carrot I ate the other day was just almost bland to me, whereas when I first started eating healthy I was actually enjoying it and it felt fresh and new. When I eat desserts, I still enjoy those, and if I eat peanut butter on things that's still nice and cheese is great (even though I shouldn't be eating it so much due to being sensitive to lactose). Savory snacks like crackers are nice but not so much nuts (despite enjoying peanut butter, right?). But hell, even eating a seasoned steak tonight, I just stopped eating half through because it just felt so ""blech."" The smell of it kind of grossed me out. Almost like a disgust but not quite to the point of feeling sick. As in, I do not feel like I am going to throw up eating it. It's just like an aversion that is making eating a lot of different foods feel not so enjoyable. For some things it's the texture getting to me and other things are just bland or even if they are seasoned, it's like I don't like the seasoning, which is so odd for me since I like seasoned things. It's just kind of unfamiliar to be this way towards food. So has anyone else ever experienced this before? Nothing super extreme has changed in my life other than I am starting an online business but I'm not sure how that would change my eating habits that much. I also added black seed oil to my usual vitamin routine (magnesium, vit D, vit C/collagen, fish oil, and zinc).

My boyfriend actually made me drink raw milk. At first, I hated it. He told me I was too skinny and I didn't even realize it, but now I see that I was very skinny.

And last year, after restricting too much, I've had more chocolate than ever even if I used to have it often before too. But like it got to the point that one day couldn't pass without it. I am 26 now and I am still cig-free and have successfully cut out all sugar without craving it as much as I did last time I've quit sugar for like 10 days straight I can say. But I've started cutting it out since January 1, gradually. Cause chocolate is hard to quit. Sugar from bread is not really. The thing is I still have a bit of fruit, but I never seem to eat enough of it. It's also winter so not much I can eat that doesn't irritate my stomach is available.

 Either way, since I've quit sugar, I had a beer or two but stopped that. Only to start drinking coffee, and by that, I mean just one a day. Hear me out, that might not seem like much but that's how it starts. Energy levels down from the lack of sugar made me have one and now I don't want to stop. And I know coffee is not as worse as sugar. No way. Even though I got anxiety haha...it's not funny though. Yet I am kinda fine though the mental fog from lack of sugar has been killing me.

diet,"Aajonus Vonderplanitz, nutritionist of the Primal Diet has a few protocols that he gives his clients for weight loss. One protocol, which can be applied raw or cooked, I will explain here.

He has his clients drink vegetable juice, and raw eggs. Thats it. Until you lose the weight. The vegetable juice had electrolytes, and will keep your digestion functioning well. The eggs, containing every nutrient in existence, are the easiest to digest food. They fully digest in about 30 minutes. The protein contains all the amino acids, and combined with good raw animal fat, the eggs provide great focus and energy. This also gives the intestines a great break because the egg completely digests at the very beginning of the intestines. 

But, I mean, you could eat hard boiled eggs and drink cucumber juice. You won’t get the benefit of giving the intestines a break. You’ll feel more shitty. Less energy. But you could do it. If you are scared of salmonella or something. 

I’ve never gotten sick off a raw egg. I’ve never met someone in real life who has gotten sick off of a raw egg. Good quality raw eggs though! Straight from the farm, or at least pasture raised. And don’t refrigerate it! You want the bacteria! It helps digestion! Or cook it. Don’t ban me. 

So for making the cucumber juice, a masticating juicer is best. If it is centrifugal, air will stir inside it and damage a lot of the nutrients. Better than no juice though. But you need to make it yourself, with organic cucumbers, and peel them! Very important to peel them. A lot have petroleum wax on them that is toxic. You could dice it, then blend it, then squeeze it through a strainer. You'll probably drink 1-3 cups a day. But a masticating juicer is best. You’ll get a better yield, and a higher quality juice.

Why juice? The fiber overly alkalizes the digestive tract, which prevents the digestion of the raw protein in the egg. It is very hydrating, and you’ll be more hydrated, with less liquids overall.

If you want to drink water, drink naturally carbonated sparkling water. Pellegrino is a brand I trust. Not sponsored. With carbonated water, the carbonation kills any bacteria, so it passes inspections to be sold with no chemicals . Other brands need some chemicals to deem it safe to pass inspection. Naturally carbonated mineral water is the best.

You could squeeze lemon or lime into the water for electrolytes for better hydration. 

Adding raw honey is great. Many brands that say raw, are heated often up to 160, degrees. It has to never go above 93. A majority of the time I get straight from the farmer, it is also heated. How you can tell is, eat it by itself, and if it burns your throat, it has been heated too hot at some point. The only 2 brands of honey I trust are called Really Raw which is in many health food stores, and Y.S. ORGANIC BEE FARMS. USDA ORGANIC 100% CERTIFIED ORGANIC RAW HONEY from Whole Foods in north west Arkansas.. Be really careful with your honey choice. Often, you need to take a picture of all the info of the honey at the store, and go home and email and call all of them and ask about the temperatures, heating, and storing during transportation, etc.

But honey is great. Don’t over do it though. Like 2 tablespoons per 4 ounces of water, with 4 ounces of lime or lemon juice. That is a good sports drink. You could even get raw cream, and crack a raw egg in it. The raw cream will prevent the egg from oxidizing, and provide raw fat, and the egg will give easily digested protein, for focus during whatever you are doing.

I could go into a lot more detail. I think it would have to be for other posts.

In the end:
1-3 cups of vegetable juice
.5-3 cups of mineral water with lemon/lime + honey.
12-60+ up to infinite raw eggs. You can eat as many raw eggs as you want.

Cucumbers must be organic and peeled.

Lemons/limes organic. Hand squeezed, strain seeds

Section for water from We Want to Live, Page 180 
“CARBONATED BEVERAGES AND WATERS: If a label reads “carbonation added” or “carbonated” it means that the carbonation is synthetic. Synthetic carbonation causes radicals and free radicals, resulting in mineral and oxygen deficiencies, sometimes resulting in headaches. If a label reads “naturally carbonated”, or “natural carbonation added” or “naturally sparkling”, the carbonation is natural from the well and highly charged with healthful electrolytes. See page 72.
In combination with unheated honey, naturally carbonated waters relieve most headaches. Naturally carbonated waters help relax adrenal glands. Therefore, if you are an individual with low energy, it would probably be better to drink naturally sparkling water only when needed in a remedy.”
So if you have low energy, don’t drink the carbonation. Just shake the carbonation out.
 
So with the eggs, you can eat as many as you want. If you ever get nauseous, that might be because your body is burning fat that has toxins in it and the toxins are being sent to the stomach to be neutralized by the hydrochloric acid. Don’t blame the eggs. Or the chickens are fed toxic feed with stuff like gmo corn, or soy. Chickens are scavengers, aka meat eaterns. A vegetarian diet is the worst diet a chicken could have. Make sure it is at least pasture raised. If an egg made you nauseous, maybe the egg is low quality. To combat that, if you eat the egg with a small bit of raw, unheated, unsalted cheese, the cheese will absorb anything toxic in the egg and prevent any damage. The egg is not the problem. Its the toxic feed, hormones, anything like that, that is given to the chickens. If the chicken is healthy, outside, no medicine, on healthy soil, fed no supplements, just extra bugs, or meat/organ scraps of other butchered animals on the farm. Or kill the predators and feed them to the chickens. That will make them healthy. No medicine. Just food, healthy soil, sunshine, healthy air.

Cheese also absorbs toxins that create nausea. Sometimes your body will break down toxins stored somewhere, and your body decides to send it to the stomach, to be neutralized by the hydrochloric acid to become less toxic, or if its severe, you will vomit those toxins out. Vomit is the strongest form of detox. The bacteria isn’t the problem. It will break down the toxins that are stored in the body from a lofe time of cooked food, and industrial toxins, from all sorts of things.

Whenever you need focus, just eat an egg. In about 15 minutes, you’ll start to get more energy.

This information is not a guideline to follow ir, it is just an example of what some of it would maybe look like. If you want to do it, don’t base it off of this information. Study Aajonus yourself, and do it right. Any problems that people have are always due to lack of understanding, or lack of access to the right foods. There is hundreds of hours of detailed information. There is a lot of condensed information also. But read both of his books. We Want to Live and The Recipe to Living Without Disease, in order to understand how to do it properly. Then you can get the details quoted from Aajonus himself from the help of a telegram group or another subreddit. There is a lot of information. But there are easy simple ways to start.

I would expect 1 lb lost a day, maybe up to 3, depends. If you feel too bad, or detox too hard, you need to eat the raw unsalted cheese, butter, more eggs, cut back on the vegetable juice and water, sip up to a gallon of milk a day

It is very important that you sip all liquids! If you don’t sip, you will piss out most of the nutrients. Your stomach breaks down your food, so that your intestines can digest it. If you chug anything, your intestines cant digest a lot of liquid at one time, because if it tried to, it would turn into a bunch of diarrhea. So a good rule of thumb that Aajonus recommends is about 1 oz per minute max. Or else you’ll piss it out and waste nutrients. 

Everything is better in glass. Anything that ferments in plastic will become toxic. The fermentation is a result of bacteria pre digesting the food. When it ferments in plastic, the bacteria also predigest the plastic, then the food becomes toxic. If its fresh in plastic, usually fine. Plastic wrap has a toxic chemical in it. Even when its in meat packaging. Meat touching paper is also bad. It won’t kill you though. Don’t let it sit for long! Transfer to glass. Same with milk. Transfer milk to glass. Cheese, butter, cream, honey, etc. 

Plastic is ok if its fresh and not too hot or cold. And doesn’t sit for very long. Won’t kill you if you break some of these rules. Some are more dangerous than others.

Can be done safe! The problems isn’t the food. Its the additives, packaging, heating, freezing. Keep your eggs room temperature!

Study Aajonus and base it all of him! Everything I said is based off of Aajonus. 

So how does the weight loss work? If you only eat eggs, you lose a lot of weight. That's what Aajonus says. It is true. Only eat eggs, you’ll lose a bunch of weight. And you drink the cucumber/celery juice when your thirsty, it will also keep your appetite high to eat more eggs. Aajonus recommends to eat a golfball size piece of raw beef whenever you are very hungry, but not angry-hungry. You can just do eggs though. If you aren’t into that, do the same thing , but with hard boiled eggs. But you’ll have more problems If you use pasteurized juice, you’ll have more problems. If you do fruit juice, even if raw, you’ll have more problems and be very emotional.

You really need to study a lot. The diet isn’t what's dangerous . This is just reality. He didn’t make food this way. It’s just how it is. You just have to change your understanding. To people who study diligently, it's all natural.

Suddenly I’ve been eating 800 calories a day or less! I don’t know how, and I certainly didn’t plan on it but I usually count calories on an app and noticed I’ve consistently eaten less than 850 calories for a week now. I’m a bit concerned as I’m not even that hungry without nearly as much food as I was eating before.
I feel healthier though for some reason, and like I have more energy than before.

Is it that bad to eat this little? My meals are all balanced and full of protein, and I’m finally losing some weight! (I am almost hitting ‘overweight’ with my BMI so I’m not really worried about losing ‘too much’ weight I just don’t want to be putting my body through a hard time with how little I’ve been eating (I’m a young female adult so of course I wouldn’t need as many calories as an older man for example)",What will happen if I keep eating only 800 calories a day?,1642475051

diet,"Hello everyone, I wanted to share with you my experience in losing weight healthily &amp; properly through a healthy meal plan diet.

A year ago I almost weighted 230 pounds and I tried some smoothies and other odd diet plan, however, they didn't work that well, so I was depressed and barely getting in my clothes that never fit me that well especially I am 24 years which is not old.

And people at such age can't weight that much at all because they always focus on having a comfortable life through having a good time, working out easily with no issues, (not feel ashamed when going out with friends) due to the unpleasant body shape and etc...

So, I tried a powerful and worthy diet plan called Keto Recipes and I honestly would give a huge hug to whoever created such incredible diet plan idea that changed my life from head to toe in almost months only. 

Keto Recipes is a healthy delicious meal plans that you will love eating everyday which will help you to lose weight in at least a month and get your desired weight in 2 months (you might take more based on how much you weight and are willing to lose) because I personally lost almost 18 pounds in one month only, and lost 15 more pounds in 23 days, and 17 pounds in another 30 days, so I totally lost 50 pounds in almost 3 month ONLY which is beyond my expectation because I thought I am going to take more than this.

But please stop believing whoever tells you you can lose 60 pounds in one month, because that's not possible and might be through an unsafety method, roughly you can lose between 15 to 20 pounds in one month as long as you want to do it healthily &amp; the right way with no problems because you need to slow down, don't be in a rush.

**From now guys please stop watching thousands videos about how can you lose weight and you end up with either wasting time or money or both. Time to get into the right Recipes plan and learn how to lose fat easily and healthily step by step.**

Keto Recipes are yummy meal plans in books that you will get which explains exactly and accurately how to make such amazing diet meal plan step by step.

I have been able to lose the weight by consuming fewer calories, but I'm getting to the point where it isn't comfortable anymore.

diet,"3 years ago I made a new years resolution to lose 30 pounds by next year. I kept track of what I did and this has been the only way that really worked for me. I have enough other stuff going on in my life to not try fad diets and when I did try keto I lost weight quickly but it came right back. 

I'm going to break this down into steps with what my weight was. M27(at the time) 5'11""

187: download my fitness pal and just track how much I eat ignoring what it said I should eat based on my weight. I did this for two weeks and I lost 4 pounds of holiday cheer. I weighed myself at the beginning and the end of this period and like twice in the middle. I also started taking a multivitamin and that helped me feel better in the mornings if nothing else. 

183: determine the average number of calories I was eating without even trying to diet and reduce that by 300 and started weighing myself every day. I also cut out soda and beer. Cutting out those empty calories wasn't even hard because I replaced them with actual food. I did have to supplement soda for diet soda for a little while W/E. I did this for about a month and lost 7 more pounds.

176: now it's mid March, I've lost 11 pounds, and I'm feeling pretty good about myself and April is around the corner. I sign up for a 5k in June and start by walking or using the elliptical in my apartment's gym 20 minutes every other day. Just the increase in physical activity and tracking what I was eating definitely helped me make healthier choices. I'm not wasting 800 of my daily 2100 calories on McDonald's.

165: it's now May. I haven't been fasting or anything and now instead of walking I'm able to run for about 30 minutes 4 days a week. I jog/walk the 5k in 42 minutes. I'm just happy to be outside but now I'm determined to do better. So I sign up for another one in July. 

157: I hit my goal sometime in July and my 5k time tracked via Strada was under 30 minutes so I was pretty pumped about that. My actual 5k time was just over 30 minutes. 

160: I stopped keeping track of my calories and I actually bounced back some after the 5K in July but that was ok because I was in much better shape. 

163: in August I realized not tracking calories and having beers with friends wasn't working so I went back to tracking calories and this time used the my fitness pal recommended 2200 calories to lose 5 pounds by the end of September. 

157 again: by October I was back to my goal weight and still track the calories to this day. I gained a little during the Wuhan flu lockdowns like everyone did since I couldn't work out  and I have now lost it. I was never as fat as before. 

What I learned from this experience is that tracking calories does work and you need to stay on top of it. I also learned that once you lose the first few pounds by easing into it you feel a lot better and you don't have to do anything extreme to get there. Finally doing that 5k really helped and I will recommend signing up for one to anyone who's trying to lose weight.

diet,"So, I have been on a weight loss journey for a while now and really have not learned that much :(. I have lost weight rapidly and have been excessively tired (eating around 2600 calories with one 3150 day a week) then going to about 3100 calories and would loose 2 pounds in two days then somehow on day 3 gain back 2. I have went back to the 2600 calories recently my weight did something weird again.. (193.8, 193.4,192.2,192,190,191.2,192.8, 191.2,191.2,192.4). From 190-191.2, I went out drink with my friends an came back and honestly ate around 3800 calories that night due to the fact we got a couple of free pizza (yes I am still in college). Sunday came around, I stuck to 2600 and gained again!. Kept doing this and hit stagnant and so I decided I would guess around my maintenance (3200) and then gained back a pound today which I am guessing is water weight.

With all of this information, this has been happening for at least 4 months now and I cannot seem crack the code. I want to know my maintenance but do not want to but in the time to figure it out then when I loose weight have to redo it (slowly increasing and decreasing calories until I stop loosing weight; planning on doing this once I reach my goal). 

Another problem I am having is I am 5""11"" 192.2 as of today but have always (even since I was young) have eaten a lot of food. I always have sat around 14-20% (I know this is a big range but you can get the picture) but have built a lot of muscle over the years. 

I would love suggestions on how the heck I can crack the code, develop a good relationship with food (because I have hated it recently because of problems), and be able to loose weight at a good pace and still be happy with my life!

&amp;#x200B;

I am experimenting with different things like increasing my sugar intake via fruits or sometimes sweets for instant sugar absorption (which may explain why I was craving a lot of things like sweets for some time), and I am drinking cranberry juice as according to my research, it helps boost recovery but I also learned that it is high fructose which is not easily absorbed and converted into glycogen.

I am trying (and so far succeeding mostly!) to get 100 oz of water consumed in a day. The problem is, I have to pee constantly when I do. I have found that it's more advantageous if I can front load my consumption to get as much as possible in before Noon, and then sparingly throughout the rest of the day. 

I haven't noticed any problems with this (no bloat or 'water logging' or anything like that) which is great, but i'm wondering if I'm losing out on the benefits of hydration by front-loading it like this?

diet,"I don't know if this type of post is allowed here, so my apologies in advance. 

For the past year or so I have been having some GI issues that my doctor thinks might be EoE, and right now I am on a super restricted diet - not at the direction of my doc, but simply because I have felt better after eliminating many things (previous to all of this I had a very diverse diet). All of the eliminations occurred progressively over the span of a year until about 6 months ago when I didn't have to eliminate anything else because my symptoms had pretty much dissipated. So now, at this point, I've pretty much been eating the same small list of things for the past 6 months (aside from a few failed reintroductions) and I was just wondering if this current diet is providing me with enough vitamins/nutrients. See meals listed below.

Breakfast:

* Gluten free bread, toasted, with Nuttzo keto nut butter 
* So Delicious dairy free coconut yogurt, unsweetened plain
* 1 small-medium sized apple

Lunch:

* Sandwich (either tuna, sliced baked turkey loin, or ground turkey patty/burger) with Primal Kitchen Vegan Mayo, and mixed lettuce greens
* Grapes

Dinner: 

* Mixed lettuce greens with either tuna salad, baked turkey, or ground turkey patty/burger (I alternate with whatever I didn't already have for lunch)
* Quinoa (white or multicolored) with pumpkin seeds sprinkled on top 

Bedtime Snack:

* Same as breakfast (toast, nut butter, yogurt, apple)

Other Snacks:

* Any combination of the stuff I already eat (small piece of toast with nut butter; OR small apple and yogurt; OR some leftover turkey; etc)

I know this is a VERY limited diet and I'm not looking for any recommendations on how to diversify it at the moment - I'm just curious again as to if this diet is providing me with enough nutrition, and/or if there's a possibility I might not be getting adequate intake of a certain vitamin/nutrient. I currently don't take any other supplements (I was supplementing with D3 for years but had to stop \~4-5 months ago because I started having a reaction to it). I am also not on any medications.

diet,"for my first diet which I did throughout December was a simple, well-balanced calorie deficit diet. I ate about 1000 calories deficit per day for the month. eggs on bread, berries and nuts, tomato juice, plantains and potatoes was basically what I ate. by the new year, not only had I lost *literally nothing*, but my body felt in a way it had never before. I was weak and woke up with my heart pounding, around my eyes hurt and I felt like death.

that had to stop and on to diet 2 (this takes me to last week). vegan diet. instead of restricting calories I engorged myself on bananas, potatoes, and various berries mostly. and kale. I'm not someone who is effected by food, but my first diet effected me and the second was even worse. I'm pretty sure I was ""bloated."" and I was a farting machine. thank god I work from home, but also, I was afraid to step outside. I had to look out my window to see if anyone was around before sprinting to the mailbox farting with each step. after 1 week lost 0lbs btw.

so last night, 40 days into dieting I reached my boiling point and binged. I partied with little Debbie. whatever. I literally had nothing to gain back. but onto phase 2. I watched a documentary on keto and I think this will be my third and final act. after engorging on ding dongs and birthday cupcakes (umm.. and Reece's and snickers and devil dogs and Oreos. oops) I passed out. the documentary ""fat fiction"" was saying how carbs make you crash (and much more.... it's an anti-carb documentary) so I thought hey I think they're right maybe I'll follow what they say.

This has pretty much resulted in my cravings pretty much vanishing or becoming pretty easy to manage. It also helped to get on adhd meds.

diet,"I am male, early twenties, 177 cm (5'10) and weigh 80KG right now (176 lbs).  


I started dieting strictly around a month ago - 88KG ( 194 lbs) was my initial weight. According to BMI that was way too much (BMI was around 26 and should be around 18-22 at my age) - not only BMI but my body and foremost my face were just awful / are.  


I am very much aware about nutrition, it's a topic I have always been confronted with my whole life, I am a whole book about nutrition, don't worry about that. What's good, what's bad, what's needed and all that stuff.  


So in less than a month I lost around 8 KG, however I'd say it's realistically 6-7 KG as a bit of the initial weight loss must be water loss or just the quick reaction of my strict change to a strict diet while eating pizza and soda the day before. My goal is 63-68KG as this is the perfect weight I see for myself.   


Now let's get to the serious part. I know about jojo-effect, I know about malnutrition and all that stuff, but this is what I eat daily:  


I drink 3-4 liters of water a day, however I also pee like 5-8 times a day. Almost every day looks like that:  


Fish that makes up 300 calories, salad with tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, a diet salad sauce and my daily snacks inbetween are turkey breast stripes. I accurately measured every single ingredient, sauce and thing I eat daily for my own curiousity and I couldn't believe it when I found out my daily caloric intake is 650 calories, while my daily caloric intake for body weight maintenance would be around 2750 calories.  


The thing is, in 3 weeks I can start training at  the gym again, right now I'm doing HIIT training for 25 minutes 4-5 times a week, besides that I don't do much, I work home office and casually go out with my friends when doing stuff, mostly by car.  


I feel absolutely good, I don't feel more tired than before, i feel like I got more power than before my diet (maybe placebo because I start feeling better about the daily weight loss I see on my scale?).  


My goal is to start eating more calories once I can go to the gym again, hopefully in 3 weeks I will be at &gt;75KG body weight as then I would increase my caloric intake to 1000-1300 and therefore try to convert everything to muscle.  


I don't mind losing a lot of muscle right now as I prefer becoming very lean and thin first and then train like a beast and get into form, rather than being chubby and transform that to muscle. I mostly do it for the girls.  


So my question finally: IS THAT HEALTHY? I don't feel bad, I feel good, I know about jojo-effect and all that stuff, I have an exact plan of how I am doing all of that, I eat very healthy as I am only eating fish, water and vegetables. No sugar, no fast food, no candy, chocolate or anything, I don't even salt stuff.  


Whenever I go to threads and forums I see people getting absolutely smashed for eating 1000 calories a day because everyone says that's way too less and very unhealthy. And now I am sitting here with 650 calories a day, as a male.  


What is your opinion? Can you help me please, tell me what you think of it? Keep in mind that I have been doing this for almost a month now and feel very good, I can also see results already mainly on my belly, my biggest concern is my chubby face that I hope looks more defined at 68KG. At my rate I have a caloric deficit of almost more than 2000 calories a day. If 8000 calories make a KG, then that means I would be losing 1 KG every 4 days, which would mean 5-7 KG by the end of January.

Theyd take a few sips here and there at the fountain at school, and drink milk or soda at home. Doctors were payed only recently to say you need a ton of water, in order to make money selling water. People drink way too much and it actually dries their systems because water works as a solvent. To hydrate, you need fats, and water bound in food with nutrients. So milk, veg juice, or water with lemon and honey added. Something that has water mixed with other nutrients. Without other nutrients, you’ll either piss out the water without it doing anything, or itll dilute the nutrients in a cell. The water needs to contain nutrients

If you are sedentary, a half cup to a cup and a half should be good. Maybe you’d need some more. Just sip it as you want. But never chug. Your body won’t digest any liquid well over an ounce a minute. It can’t break down bulk liquid, it’ll just pee it out. You need to sip so your body can process it well. 1-2 sips a minute, and do not gulp it.

[Meal plan with macro(2022)](https://imgur.com/a/vwJlf6E)  
Now I'm planning to start an easy-to-follow non-keto diet plan where my breakfast and last meal will be the same and only lunch will vary. From past experience, easy prep has worked well for me when I was doing keto. I also plan on doing IF(18:6) and proper gym this time. Currently, I'm doing WFH for the next 6 months so I'll include a 4-6km walk. My TDEE is 2000 cal so I'm doing an intake deficit of 550 cal and exercise on top.

I have a few questions I want your help with,  
Can you suggest a better macro ratio? Should I reduce my carb intake to get better results?  
Should I take any form of supplement?  
Is IF with high carb more difficult than IF with keto?  
What realistic weight goal can I set for the next 6-7 months doing this?

Also please let me if you see any other flaws in my plan. I'm mostly concerned doing deficit IF with such high carb will lead to hunger issues however my previous keto diet with the same deficit didn't cause any such issue. So I'm hoping this wouldn't either.

Thank you in advance and all the best with your weight loss journey in 2022.

In a sea of conflicting opinions on what that term means and how to achieve it, I would try six completely different diets myself for eight weeks at a time and take measurements before and after to compare results. Each diet taught me something different about my relationship with food. They all ""worked"" for me in different ways. As the new year is here, I would recommend to many a similar approach for many to understand how your body reacts to different ways of eating and help achieve your specific goals. Good luck out there!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

Diets tried: keto, paleo, Mediterranean, intermittent fasting, vegetarian and calorie restriction 

Measured:  blood work, blood pressure, body weight, body fat percentage and compare results at the end 

My key takeaways:

1) Seek out experts. Listen to their opinions but don’t solely rely on them. The reason it can be difficult to find the correct data on food is there’s conflicting information in the literature. Conflicting information means people are responding differently to diets. Let your body be your guide.

2) If you want to be objective, numbers are important. What’s measured is managed. But if your goal is to just feel better, then numbers aren’t essential.

3) Forgive spouses for what they’re about to go through and thank them for their support. I can’t tell you how many times I heard, “I’m not the one on the diet, you are. Feed me normal food!”

4) Being thoughtful about what you are eating has more impact than any one diet. When you focus on what you’re putting in your body, you tend to make better choices both in what you eat and the quantity you eat.",I tried six diets. Here's what I learned.,1641044098

My history with weight loss(can read if you have time)  
I had attempted to lose weight in 2018 and 2019 with varying success. in 2019 I managed to go from 115kg to 88kg in doing 1500 cal Keto OMAD and some cardio. Though I started IF with 16:8 working my way up to OMAD. Didn't do any exercise except 3km of pace walking. Thanks to this effort I was able to lose about 44lbs. [Progress graph (2019)](https://imgur.com/dj74pqS). However, due to many reasons, I couldn't keep up with the weight loss. I'm am starting my dream job in August thus I plan to do as much as possible in the next 7 months and plan to continue some aspects of this even further.

[Meal plan with macro(2022)](https://imgur.com/a/vwJlf6E)  
Now I'm planning to start an easy-to-follow non-keto diet plan where my breakfast and last meal will be the same and only lunch will vary. From past experience, easy prep has worked well for me when I was doing keto. I also plan on doing IF(18:6) and proper gym this time. Currently, I'm doing WFH for the next 6 months so I'll include a 4-6km walk. My TDEE is 2000 cal so I'm doing an intake deficit of 550 cal and exercise on top.

I have a few questions I want your help with,  
Can you suggest a better macro ratio? Should I reduce my carb intake to get better results?  
Should I take any form of supplement?  
Is IF with high carb more difficult than IF with keto?  
What realistic weight goal can I set for the next 6-7 months doing this?

Also please let me if you see any other flaws in my plan. I'm mostly concerned doing deficit IF with such high carb will lead to hunger issues however my previous keto diet with the same deficit didn't cause any such issue. So I'm hoping this wouldn't either.

Thank you in advance and all the best with your weight loss journey in 2022.",Need feedback on my diet &amp; workout plan,1641039313

diet,"First post here, so I apologize any possible chance of me using the wrong subreddit for such question. In that case it would be very appreciated if you could suggest me a subreddit fit for my post.

I also notify you that I am not in any way shape or form a medical expert or have parents that are. I'm just a random internet 16 year old heavily concerned about their friend's health.

I have a friend online. We've been friends for over a year, and while in the past we weren't much close, and we simply slightly knew eachother, in the last months our friendship grew exponentially. We started opening up to eachother and reveal things that not even our irl friends know. 
In the past, I kept noticing how my friend did accidentally mention from time to time how they used to ""live in a hospital"", how their mother is extremely germaphobic and is relunctant to let them go outside. I sometimes asked them why was that, but they often ignored the message and switched the topic. While I was very hesitant, and fearful of being insensitive, I couldn't keep my questions to myself, and I used this opportunity to directly and clearly ask them about it. (This happened a few weeks ago)
Turns out, they told me to have suffered from a bad eating disorder at the age of 11 and they were recovered for 2 months, and at the age of 13 they suffered from a worse one, and this time they were recovered for 6 months. In the present day they are 16 and are all clean and don't suffer from such problems any longer. They also told me that they have an autoimmune disease, but I don't know if it manifested or caused after their eating disorder or if they had it since childhood.
This one is the important part. While they described it as ""hyperactive immune system"", I tried to do my searches, and I think they meant an autoimmune disease. They explained how they have to take medicines and blood infusions from time to time that destroy their immune system so that it doesn't damage their body any longer. 

This is the copy &amp; paste of the reply they sent to me after asking them (I know I'm kind of violating their privacy but I really need some advice from you reddit fellas!):

""o i just saw this lol (nux takus new vid is sus and i was watching that... 0-0) two things: when i was 11 i had a really bad eatng disorder and i went to a hospital for that twice, first for 2 months and the second when i was 13 for 6 months, im good now and that isnt a problem anymore. 2) i have a hyperactive immune system so i have to take meds and blood infusions that practically remove my immune system so it doesnt damage my body anymore, my meds now are decreasing a bit so im gonne get some immunity back soooon""

From their behaviour, it didn't seem to me, to be an autoimmune disease that specifically targets the brain or heart, as such a lethal one. And I sure hope this isn't the case. And they never mentioned to be in any way physically impaired. And as such I doubt it is one that affects joints or like a form of arthritis.
They didn't mention having diabetes type 1 either. Because if it was the case, instead of saying ""meds"" I believe that they would have said ""insuline"" since it would be easier to understand for most people.
By searching the most common autoimmune diseases, I came to the conclusion, that what they would most likely be suffering from would be Lupus. Hopefully not a severe form, although the fact that they use blood infusions lends me to believe that this isn't the case...

Anyway, this is the reason why I mentioned the carnivore diet in the title. While I am sure you guys know much more about this than I do, but from what I read the carnivore diet seems to help with autoimmune diseases a lot, and heard of many cases of people practically curing their lupus (although it is supposed to be an incurable disease) thanks to the carnivore diet. From what I read the basis of this carnivore diet is to not ""simply eat only meat"". Eating only steaks all day wouldn't be beneficial. The carnivore diet includes the consumption of unprocessed meat, meat that is plainly cooked without adding unhealthy sauces or condiments, organs (most primarly, the liver), fresh eggs and raw milk.
Do you suggest me to propose this diet to my friend? I think it may help them at least lessen the effects of their disease. But of course, I'm not an idiot. In the case you aggred to my idea, I would first make sure that their disease is actually lupus, but even if it wasn't do you think it would still help as long as it is an autoimmune disease? Second, I would also absolutely remind them to NOT blindly follow my suggestion and just make an internet search and follow a diet. I would tell them my proposal, just as something they can try to ask their doctor or a dietitian and see if it could work with them. As I do know that the effects of a diet, change a lot based on individuals. I think it could be possible since from what I have seen their family doesn't seem to struggle with money.

Please answer to all of my questions redditors, it would help me so much, and I would be very grateful if you could spend your time writing a reply to this.

So I got back into consistent lifting and dieting 1.5 years ago. But recently I’ve had some issues with my dieting. I used to put myself in a 500 calorie surplus when bulking up, and a 300 calorie deficit when cutting. However, I have been on a 300 calorie deficit for 8 weeks now with negative results. These results frequently come from carbs. I usually run 1 carb load day for every 3 non carb days. But when I have my one carb day and hit my macros (2500 calories 40% carb 40% protein 20% fat) I end up having a drastic loss of appetite and horrible bloating for all three of my no carb days. 

Even during bulks the carb bloat is so incredibly severe that I can hardly eat. And this comes from even a sandwich made with an English muffin, or a couple skinless potatoes. This causes me to under eat and then miss my calorie goals which I believe has slowed my metabolism/energy to the point where my deficit becomes impossible to maintain and get adequate protein. 

Is there something I should be looking into? Would a blood panel or something help here? I’ve never had this issue and it’s came up in the last 18 months.
