I am a 30 year old female, and I just failed a pretty important exam that I will retake next year. During that exam, I noticed I couldn't concentrate past the 2 hours marks (the exams last 4 hours and I had 5 of them).

So exercising is one of my commitment for that year. I am rather thin, but I never exercised other than walking a bit, which is why my endurance is pretty much non-existant.

I was planning on doing yoga and/or pilates for 20 to 30 minutes every morning and trying to swim for 30 minutes two times a week for a start. I tried to look for swim workouts, but I got discouraged at the 1'500 meters per workout, lol.

I used to run 6 miles every other day even at my weight. I just enjoyed it alot.

So here's my problem, I can't do the exercise I loved anymore.

I am overweight. Not like unhealthy fat, can't walk or anything like that, I just have too much belly fat. I'm around 162cm (not measured myself for quite a while, but this is approximate) and around 65kg. These are rough numbers, not 100% sure about them.
So, I'm generally not very happy with my body, and I'm really not comfortable with my body around other people. So now is the 13th of October. The summer is coming in next year, and I am going on a summer holiday with a bunch of my friends in August. I wanna transform until then. I wanna be comfortable with my body so I can enjoy my holiday. As I've calculated, it's around 9 months from now.
I really don't care about the number that the scale gives me, as I know that muscles are heavier than fat, so I know I will gain weight if I workout (lose fat, but build muscles). I just wanna get fit and start building muscles (but I don't wanna be a bodybuilder or anything, just have some abs and muscly arms,..)
Currently, I have belly fat, and my chest is big, and I don't know why that is (is it fat too or what?)
I cycle regularly, going for my first 100km ride this weekend, but I won't be able to ride my bike during winter so much.


What is the best way for me to lose the fat? What workouts to do? And can someone please tell me more about calories intake/outtake and how I wanna measure that, etc.?

As I said, I have around 8 months to accomplish my goal, and I know change isn't coming overnight, but I think 8 months is a pretty reasonable timeframe for my goals.

1,"I’m a 22-year-old male who weighs 157, so that makes my BMI 26.9, which means I’m overweight. I’ve been wanting to do exercise for my health, as well as lose weight. I used to go to the gym at my college, and weighed around 140-145 (can’t exactly remember but it’s around that range). 

However, since the pandemic, I’ve been stuck at home, doing nothing but lazing about and eating unhealthy. Fast-food is sometimes my comfort, and sometimes I eat out of boredom. It’s also been draining my wallet. 

I often eat with large proportions at night, and usually have some sweets too (like iced coffee, which I have to have sugar and milk with). I also eat a large amount super fast. It’s hard to quit, cause I get my cravings a lot. I’m also very picky, and don’t eat a lot of vegetables. I do eat fruit from time to time.

I’ve tried pacing the times that I eat, but at night, I get so hungry that I just want to shove as much food in my mouth and call it a day.

As for the gym situation, I’ve been having a lack of motivation. My college is 20 minutes away, and I often refrain from going due to the effort of driving back and forth. Just to go for an hour. In addition, I go there twice a week, with very late afternoon classes. So I’m drained from that. I also work too. 

I tried a one-day pass at a gym next to me, but I didn’t want to spend money each month. The college gym is free.

I have some equipment at home. I have two 20 lbs. dumbbells as well as a pull-up bar, but get drained easily, and I just want to put them down. For the pull-up bar, I used to do a lot, but now, it’s hard to do so cause of my weight.

So all in all i just use the treadmill for 8-10min a day but I was wondering if it might have any negative effects doing it everyday without giving any days for rest and also to get the heart close to max everyday. 

I really suck at keeping habits if they aren't everyday so that's why I do it like this."

I had a baby 6 months ago and had a rough recovery (emergency c-section, lots of blood loss, infection etc) but have been signed off for exercise for the last three months. Prior to having a baby, I didn’t do much weight lifting, I was more cardio- I ran 5 days a week averaging 40+ km per week. Not being able to exercise in pregnancy and for three months afterwards was a mood killer and tough on me mentally and physically.

For the past three months I have been working hard in the gym. I knew I couldn’t just get back to running everyday without injury so my training schedule is as follows: two runs a week of 5km each time (building distance up gradually, I’m finally at 5k without needing to stop for a rest), three gym sessions per week (I run for twenty mins on the treadmill and then do a mixture of weights and body weight exercises- back squats (I’m upto 40kg so far), deadlifts (I’m at 80kg now), chest press etc, for an hour each session.

While I was assembling the bike, I noticed that the wheel doesn't fully line up with the brake pad all the time, because it isn't straight - it's slightly curved. The wheel has a wobble to it, when you pedal it lines up perfectly with the pad, and then moves to the right, then to the center, then back to the right.

I start to sweat and itching sensation are on my head, arms, back and face. After a big while of continuing to exercise, it all goes away and im normal. But the next day, i start to sweat, it happens and goes away like always. What is this? Im a frequent exerciser, from ageas 10-15, everything was absolutely normal and i never had this. Until around 16 and now im 17, this started. Is it because of quarantine and not exercising? I started exercising for the past month but its bothering me.

1,"The weather where I live is finally getting nice enough to run again. A friend of mine invited me to go running on a really nice scenic run weekly that is about 10 miles in distance. I'm running into an issue where even though my cardio health feels fine - I'm not getting super elevated heart rate, and my breathing seems OK, and I'm not uncomfortable in that aspect, I find that my legs just absolutely start locking up and tightening. It gets really uncomfortable as early as 3-4 miles into the run (we load up the first part of the run with hills.. there's two ways to go and we can either take the hills at the start or the end, which we opt for the start).  

The other activity I take part in is crossfit 3-4x a week. I have been at it since about October of 2020 (so close to a year now) and we do a lot of leg workouts there, but most of our running is sprinting. The massage therapist I go to mentioned that my IT band is like a rock and that it shouldn't be that way. We do a lot of leg work outs at my gym, but I usually have 2-3 days of rest before the 10 mile run which is typically enough for any soreness / fatigue to go away. So I'm usually starting the run pretty fresh.

I stretch before and after every work out (including the run), and roll out my legs often, and even do cupping treatment on my quads / IT band. 

I guess my questions are:

* Is loading the hills at the start of the run a bad idea?
* Does anyone have a recommended video on youtube or something that could help me identify good running form to avoid this?
* I wear Saucony shoes and am curious if it could partially be my shoes causing me to ""hit the ground"" in ways that are wiping out my legs quickly?
* Obvious question is.. I can run the 10 miles and it sucks. Should we cut it down to 5 or 7 for the first few runs? I take a couple of breaks on the run now, but it's an addicting feeling. I go out there and burn 1500 calories on my run at the start of the day and I just feel serene for the remainder of the day. 

Other thing to note is that the feeling I get isn't really muscle fatigue. It's just a general tightness in my legs and discomfort.","Legs ""locking up"" while running - curious if anyone has any strategies to avoid this","Legs ""locking up"" while running - curious if anyone has any strategies to avoid this The weather where I live is finally getting nice enough to run again.

So over the past couple of months, I lost quite a bit of fat and built up a decent amount of muscle. Yay! The problem now is, because of the fat loss I’ve been feeling a lot colder lately, and going into the winter months this may suck because I also have poor blood circulation, does anyone have any advice on staying warm? I can always put on extra layers but if there’s some body or exercise technique I can use I’d appreciate any advice.

1,"I may just be rambling here, but from personal experience I have to say running is the king of cardio. That is, speaking from purely a conditioning standpoint. 

I’ve worked out for 20 years (now 34). I was a fat kid. Started walking, then jog walk, then running. Gradually I stopped running and switched over to weights, exercise bike and jump rope. My resting heart rate is/was 48. I’m 5’11, 207 lbs. I lift 3 days a week, cardio 3 days a week. I thought I was in decent shape. 

Then I ran a 5k outside. 

Talk about being humbled. Couldn’t even finish the hills without taking a breather the first week. I ran a 30:37 and now 3 weeks later I’m at 28:30. Would love to get down to sub 25.

Im mainly just posting this because it was very eye opening for me. I’ve researched “which cardio is best” and the answers seem to vary. Obviously running can be taxing on your knees and back, so there are cons. But I’m absolutely convinced now that running is levels beyond any other cardio for pure endurance. 

If you disagree, I’d be curious to hear your thoughts.

Is it indeed dangerous or at risk for straining one side of my body?

I'm hoping a few of you have encountered this and have some advice on how to get past it. While in quarantine I really let my cardio health slip and I promised myself that when I got fully vaxed, I'd throw myself into exercising. I turned 30 this summer and heart health has been an issue in my family and it's something I want to avoid. Since I started doing a lot of cardio I feel loads better. However, I feel like I'm hitting a plateau in my cardio exercise. 

My routine since mid-June has been to do about 30 minutes of high intensity interval training every weekday morning. My fitness trackers on my apple watch showed noticeable improvements on an almost weekly basis. I could feel the progress and it was really encouraging. In the past couple weeks I increasingly feel like I'm hitting a wall though. Whereas before, when maybe 45 seconds to a minute of high intensity exercise would get me to my target heart rate, I now have trouble getting up to and holding my target heart rate. It's not that I'm exercising less intensely either, if anything I can tell I'm putting in even more effort than before. It's basically like my heart health has improved so much that the old exercises aren't as much of a challenge anymore. 

I've tried upping my goals, going more intensely in my interval training or trying to do longer intervals and I've had some success in that. Except past a certain point I feel like I just run out of gas. Basically, it feels like my cardio health is so good now that I don't have the energy when I exercise do actually give my heart a workout anymore.

I can't use the gym at work anymore (they're still requiring people to book ""time-slots"" to protect against covid), and there's only one ""gym"" within 30 min of my house,  and it seems mainly dedicated to being a yoga space, no real weights or anything.

For reasons beyond this, I'm considering moving, but have considered either investing in a stationary bike, or possibly an electric bike (hear me out before dismissing it!).

Honestly, my *only* goal right now is weight loss. So burning calories is great, but just as important *for me*, is just ""time spent doing *something*"", that isn't thinking about eating. I've never been in great health, but I've definitely noticed that the more bored I am, the more I tend to ""snack"". I've gotten rid of pretty much all that type of food, but I feel like I need some sort of mental stimulation.

The other idea I've considered is picking up an electric bike. The idea honestly never crossed my mind, until a coworker of mine was talking about it, and mentioning he feels way better. I sort of laughed at first, thinking ""don't those things basically ride themselves?"", and his response that he only really uses the ""electric"" part of it, when he's going up particularly difficult hills, or if he's been riding all day, and just feels exhausted.

He made kind of a compelling case for it; that when he had a normal bike, he only went for a ride once or twice a month, but because the electric bike deals with ""the hard stuff"", he's actually going riding pretty much every day because it's so much more enjoyable. Particularly if I wind up moving back down south near my family, I could also see something like that being useful for my father, who has back issues but really *needs* some amount of light exercise.

I mean, at least with the electric bike, at the very least it provides some amount of ""entertainment value"". For a stationary bike, though, I'm unsure how useful those are for actively burning calories, or if that's just an expense that's realistically unlikely to make much if an impact on my actual weight-loss journey?",Are stationary bikes -- or electric bikes -- an effective way to burn calories?,"Are stationary bikes -- or electric bikes -- an effective way to burn calories?

I sort of laughed at first, thinking ""don't those things basically ride themselves?"", and his response that he only really uses the ""electric"" part of it, when he's going up particularly difficult hills, or if he's been riding all day, and just feels exhausted.

He made kind of a compelling case for it; that when he had a normal bike, he only went for a ride once or twice a month, but because the electric bike deals with ""the hard stuff"", he's actually going riding pretty much every day because it's so much more enjoyable. Particularly if I wind up moving back down south near my family, I could also see something like that being useful for my father, who has back issues but really *needs* some amount of light exercise.

I mean, at least with the electric bike, at the very least it provides some amount of ""entertainment value"". For a stationary bike, though, I'm unsure how useful those are for actively burning calories, or if that's just an expense that's realistically unlikely to make much if an impact on my actual weight-loss journey?"

Best if it isn't dependent on being at a gym (like for a rock wall) or having to drive somewhere to do it.  
 

What I’ve thought of so far: Roller skate dancing, Hula Hoop Dance, Jump Rope Dance, [Hackysack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_Gd0Lo0GU), Shuffle Dance, Hip-Hop, basically any dance style, skateboarding."

Hi guys so I'm new to fitness and I need advice about my chest injury. I did some delt stretches with cables two weeks ago and I'm pretty sure it caused my chest injury due to incorrect form. I'm not sure how serious it is but it has been plaguing me for 2 weeks now.

I first noticed it when washing my hands or hanging my towel but I thought nothing of it. A couple of days later it still didn't get better but it is barely noticeable so I had my chest day (bench press, cable fly, dips, push up). I didn't feel any pain until the following day when I sneezed really hard. From then on it seems like the pain increased sharply. Washing my hands no longer hurts but it hurts if I sit up from a lying down position. It hurts if I sneeze or cough or have hiccups. But it doesn't really hurt if I do bench presses or push-ups which is weird. Wider push-ups hurt a bit more though.

I took some meds a few days ago and it seems to be getting better but just now I sneezed really hard again and all of the pain came back. Btw I stopped doing ALL exercises since last week. Idk if I should go see a doctor or physical therapist. For routine, I mostly copied Athlean X's perfect exercises.

Edit: It hurts the most if I do a particular core exercise: Opposite side elbow to knee when in the plank position and I try to touch my left elbow with my right knee while supported by my right arm and left foot.",Need advice on chest injury due to exercise,"Need advice on chest injury due to exercise

i plan to do some exercises during the weekend morning, saturday and sunday only since  i have a regular job during weekdays from 8am to 5pm 

as the title already says, i have a big belly and some man boobs, any exercises that you can recommend to me to lose this? 

i did some google-ing and i saw that most of the exercises to remove man boobs are  barbell press, bench press, pec deck etc.. which all require gym equipment and i dont have those nor the money to buy them.. most of the gyms in our country are also closed because of the pandemic 

i also have weak lungs so i get tired very easily and i catch my breath easily but i can do high intensity workouts if needed 

any recommendations for people like me? 

all comments would be highly appreciated

1,"Hi folks, hoping for some advice. I'm 25f, healthy weight maybe leaning towards the lower side, looking to get into some kind of exercise routine. I get exercise induced panic attacks which makes things hard.

I used to jog/run and did it pretty consistently, did some 10k races and a half marathon etc but honestly it made me very depressed and anxious. The majority of the time I would either get a panic attack or feel so low that I would harm myself after. So I said bye to that, but I was probably at my fittest then (2019). I love hiking and hillwalking but don't have any peaks near me, so can only go inconsistently. I love walking but feel like it doesn't do enough to raise my heart rate. I have a gym nearby but the cost and not knowing what to do scares me. I used to go to a private gym and work out in a small group, but I mainly ended up on the side with panic attacks (I was also super depressed at the time lol). I used to skate on a roller Derby team which I loved, but covid ended that. I also used to do yoga semi regularly but now I'm out of the habit when I don't have space inside. I've tried getting into a routine of body weight exercises but they rarely stick and when I go hard, I just panic badly. 

I have a small outside space that I can use. I've tried looking for bodyweight routines on YouTube but I'm lost with where to begin. Everything just feels so overwhelming. I've recently changed jobs which allows for a lot more time to exercise, I just don't know what I can do and where to begin. It sounds dumb but I could cry thinking about it. I have GAD so that might go some way to explaining it, and I feel like this is all actually classic GAD avoidance/excuses because it gives me a lot of anxiety about getting panic attacks. But I want to have something in place, I just don't know what.

What a day to be alive. Hope you’re all striving towards your goals. 

I just wanted to write this to anyone pushing late nights/ early mornings/ struggling to do either. Whether it’s working or not, I’m proud of you for making the decision to change. 

I was once where you were. Wasn’t happy with my body, was eating junk all day long, was pretty depressed and was giving into instant gratification all day long because I didn’t have that motivation or drive to get to where I needed to be. 

I know a lot of you have been trying really hard to either get your body back in shape or come back from a dark place. Some of you want to start exercising regularly, while some have been doing it and not getting results. Some just need to make that mental change. I understand you. 

It’s crazy looking back at the old me now. I was so lost. I’m just here to tell you that your destiny is completely under your control no matter who you are. Everyone has a different story or a different way they need to approach their goals, but all of us are going to make it. I’m not going to settle until I get everyone in this group to their goals, or simply changes their mentally so you all can get at your goals yourselves. 

The old me used to watch YouTube all day long. It took me a while to realize why this was, and now almost 3 months later, I can now say that I’m exactly where I need to be. 

You can do this. Current you struggling = future you proud. We either do it now or regret it later. 

My goal is to change 1000 people’s lives this year. I’m already at 255 starting from March. Whether it’s mentality, weight loss, muscle gain, getting into running or anything else I’ll probably be the right fit. 

What are you struggling with currently? I’ll see if I or someone else in the comments can help you.

Huberman claims that this methodology is being used by lots of sports teams and that they've been getting great results.

Frankly, this sounds way too good to be true.

I'm a 21-year-old 162 cm (5' 4"") male. I started walking for exercise on the streets of Lebanon after finally putting myself on a program to lose weight. When I started, I was 105 KG/231 lbs. I dropped 7 Kilos down to 98 KG/216 lbs. This was all between July 16 and August 27.

I started walking exactly 1000 steps/0.4 KM a day and gradually increased it to 13,000 steps/10 KM (which is the most I've ever walked in a single day) These walks I do are on Lebanese streets, which are far from the standard flat-surfaced sidewalks in other countries. Throughout the program, I've not felt much pain from the walking besides the standard soreness and, once, numb feet for a few hours after a walk.

Now, three days ago, my family and I went up to our village in the mountains, and I decided to take a break from walking for at least a week while I'm there. After resting for a full day, I woke up the day after with severe pain in my Knee Joints. They don't hurt when I cross my legs or keep them straight, but hurt like a motherf***er everywhere in between. It's very hard to walk in the house, let alone a 13,000 step walk.

I have a treadmill that's been sitting in the basement for a couple years, a couple weeks ago I brought it out and made it usable again.

In my past attempts to get fit, I've had a pattern of being too ambitious and either burning out or hurting myself. This time, My strategy is to start with a long term plan to gradually ramp up. My treadmill has speed increments of 0.1 mph and inclination increments of 0.5%, so from 0% inclination at 2.2 mph to 10% inclination at 10 mph, there are 1659 combinations of speed and inclination. If I do a different combination every day, it should take me about 4.5 years to work up to max out my treadmill. I've read that 4 miles per day is a sustainable amount of exercise without wearing out knees, hips, etc... So my tentative plan is to do 4 miles a day, each day at a different combination of speed and inclination, until I'm maximizing out my treadmill.

Should i do some concrete exercises to prevent that, or do i just have to train all my body? i honestly do not know if that way the fat would become muscle or something like that (if you could explain it to me or smth but that’s opcional). As you can see, i’ve never trained in my life haha.

2) are there any good, reputable workout regiments online that are tried and true to help bulk up?

1) when i go to the gym, i usually just use the machines because i otherwise have no idea what i'm doing. is that good enough to gain muscle?

2) are there any good, reputable workout regiments online that are tried and true to help bulk up?

1,"I am a 5ft 4in female. 22 years of age and go to the gym 3x a week, MWF. I started at 215 lbs and am now 212 lbs. I have been exercising with this routine since July 8th. I am trying to lose 70 lbs by this time next year to start. Is my workout regimine going to get me to my goal within 1 year? What can I do to target fat loss in addition to this? I currently cook all my meals and eat chicken breast, and half of my meal consists of a nutrient dense veggie like Kale, Spinach, cauliflower, mushroom etc... I don't like pasta or rice but i make 1 cup of rice and that lasts me 4 meals. I'll usually make rice 2 or 3x a month for filler. I'm trying to cut out most sugar and replace it with fruit. Most of the time I don't eat breakfast or I'll have a protein shake when I get home. However I do snack heavily and am cutting down on buying junk food to replace with whole foods. I eat Sardines or tuna as a late night snack, but slip up with junk sometimes so I don't buy it anymore unless I've been consistent for 3 weeks straight. Also no more food orders except for 3x a month. 

My workout includes: 

3 sets of weighted sumo squats with 10 reps each. Set 1: 10lbs. Set 2: 20 lbs. Set 3: 35lbs
100 bicycle kicks
50 side crunches on each side
100 crunches
10 minutes walking on a treadmill 

Hip adduction/abduction machine (5 sets of 10 reps at 100 lbs for abduction and 60lbs for adduction). 
Leg press: 5 sets of 10 reps @ 200 lbs of weight. 
Hamstring machine: 50 lbs 5 sets of 10 reps. 

For arms I use bicep (25 lbs 10 reps; 5 sets) and tricep machines (35 lbs 15 reps; 5 sets) as well as a rowing machine.  This workout will take me about 2 hours then I walk home mostly and get about 7,000-10,000 steps in to and from the gym since I'll walk to the grocery store to pick up veggies before I head home and feel energized. I don't feel tired after this workout and have seen a big improvement in my strength, but I'd like to lose fat as well. Or am I just being impatient?

1,"Hi,

Something I’ve been curious about for some time is the issue of whether protein ingested long before a workout will actually aid in muscle protein synthesis, or if it will simply be used for energy.

There’s information about eating windows online, but much of it pertains to whether protein ingested a short time before a workout will aid in growth. Obviously, if you have been working out with weights within 48 hours of the meal, then your body will be a heightened state of protein synthesis inherently, so in that case it’s easily assumed that protein intake early in the day will aid with that. However, assume that the individual is untrained, or has simply had a few days off training. Will protein ingested at 9am aid in muscle growth for that day if the workout doesn’t occur until 5pm?",Early Morning Protein Usability,"Early Morning Protein Usability Hi,

What are some good exercises for burning fat and good exercises for building muscle? I’ve got a weight bench at home I can use. So far I’ve been doing bench press, low weight and high repetition, I usually do about 15 reps of 10 every workout, over about 30 minutes. I feel that may not be intense enough so would like others opinions on it.

What types of foods would be beneficial, both as a snack to eat before hand and recovery, as well as just general food tips.

How would intermittent fasting affect me now that I’m starting to be more active?

1,"Hi everyone.

I used to love jogging on the Wii Fit. (Well, not “love”, exactly, but “hate marginally less than other forms of exercise” sounds a little negative.) It was very simple: put the controller in your pocket, and its accelerometer would determine your approximate jogging speed as you ran on the spot, with your avatar running through a much nicer world than the one you were actually in.

That was fourteen years ago. But I can’t find anything that comes close today. The closest I can find is Zwift, but leaving aside the fact that it’s littered with endless menus and lists of stats and is clearly aimed at serious people who do lots of running/cycling, you have to buy a pretty expensive “foot pod” to actually make your avatar run at the speed you’re jogging at. I have a treadmill (my wife’s anyway), but Zwift’s own foot pods seem to be permanently out of stock and alternative ones are hopelessly expensive.

There’s an app that promises to get around this: Treadmill Smart Speed, which you put on your phone and then use the phone like the Wii Fit controller of old, sending your running speed via Bluetooth to Zwift running on another device. This is exactly what I want! Except that it doesn’t work. It doesn’t register my speed most of the time; when it does, it has a huge lag; and it sends the speed to Zwift only intermittently.

So this is my question. I want an experience like Wii Fit jogging, where you put a phone or something similar in your pocket and a character on your TV screen runs through a virtual environment accordingly. Ideally I’d like it to be something simple enough for a small child to use - just like Wii Fit itself. Does anything like this exist on any platform? Or are we stuck endlessly running round Wiifitty Island for ever more?",Running games?,"Running games? Hi everyone.

So my question to y’all; do you have any specific workout regimes to build muscle, while remaining slim/slender. I’m 6’1 (male 33, sw 200, BMI 25%) and my ideal weight would be 185ish. I’m committing to 4-5 sessions a week, upwards of 2 hours a day. Thank you in advance."

I only did the routine for 3 days. In the second I got the soreness, but, in my chest, it came way stronger on the muscles right below my armipts, on the 2 sides of my chest, with barely any soreness on the muscles of the front chest.

I just wanted to know if this is normal or if I'm doing something wrong?

1,"I injured myself doing squats. I’d been doing them every day for a few weeks when I started noticing that my lower back was getting sore. I thought it was just regular tightness from working out. 

One morning, my lower back was stiff and even sitting down hurt. I realized it wasn’t pain from building muscle, but pain from overuse or poor form. 

A friend of mine took a look at my posture and said I might be overextending my back. 

I’ve heard that when doing squats, you should always keep your knees behind your toes and your butt should stick out. I think that might be why I overextended my back. 

I’m not sure how to continue doing squats, as I don’t want this to happen again. I’ve had to stop my workout schedule in order to allow time to heal, but two days ago I tried to work out again and the pain got worse again.

1,"I am 5’11” and have reduced from 82kg to 78kg (for reference, I was 76kg when I moved, but actually looked bigger than I am now - would post picture If I wasn’t self-conscious)

I used to be really active, and I played cricket at a pretty decent level before I moved very far from home (other side of the world). I know what it takes to ‘workout’, and had a set routine based around the sport I played. I could go to a gym and know what I was doing to benefit my performance. Since moving away, I can’t really play the sport (the standard is not really good enough to commit the time taken to play), but I remained active in other pursuits and felt healthy. 

During these Covid times, I gained a little weight, and have managed to reduce a little myself at home. I don’t really have the time to make it to a gym to work out in the way I am familiar, and I don’t really want to be around other people in a place that encourages spread of virus/bacterium.

I am not familiar with working out at home, and have limited materials.

I have been basically doing 4 day, trying to work on specific areas with the equipment I have (very minimal) and I am looking for some variety, or organisation of activities to maximise benefit whilst not increasing time. 

Equipment:

* Skipping rope
* Push-up handles
* Resistance bands (reasonably high max load)
* Dumbbells (you know the York ones in a box, not high max load)
* Recently bought a rowing machine (identical to a c2 - stoked on this tbh)
* Yoga mat

I’ve basically been rowing 30 mins a day (no skipping) or 15mins rowing and 15mins skipping depending on how I feel (side note I hate running, but sometimes run 5k), along with targeting - Chest/triceps, back/biceps, Shoulders/core and Legs

I am wondering if anyone could help me to:

ok so first things first: please do NOT tell me about the balance between weight loss and muscle growth. That does not answer my question at all. I strictly want to know how long it would take someone to make their abs noticeably larger.

For example, if someone were to go from the right picture to the left picture, how long would it take. [http://www.leighpeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/10-percent-body-fat-male-pictures1.jpg](http://www.leighpeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/10-percent-body-fat-male-pictures1.jpg)

(and please don't tell me the time it takes depends on the quality of the training either. I want advice that's actually helpful...)

I've heard that abs can be trained every day so let's assume we're doing an ab workout every day and eating protein in amounts somewhere around 0.8g/lb bodyweight and in a slight caloric surplus (250 kcal). yes i know it depends on the person but i just want a ballpark number. all the answers online are so useless and say cop-outs like ""everyone's different"" or ""you have to lose fat to see abs"" and they never even attempt to answer the question. I want a very rough estimate like ""2 months."" something i can work with.",How long does it take to develop ab muscles so they are visible?,"How long does it take to develop ab muscles so they are visible?

For example, if someone were to go from the right picture to the left picture, how long would it take. [http://www.leighpeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/10-percent-body-fat-male-pictures1.jpg](http://www.leighpeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/10-percent-body-fat-male-pictures1.jpg)

(and please don't tell me the time it takes depends on the quality of the training either. I want advice that's actually helpful...)

I've heard that abs can be trained every day so let's assume we're doing an ab workout every day and eating protein in amounts somewhere around 0.8g/lb bodyweight and in a slight caloric surplus (250 kcal). yes i know it depends on the person but i just want a ballpark number. all the answers online are so useless and say cop-outs like ""everyone's different"" or ""you have to lose fat to see abs"" and they never even attempt to answer the question. I want a very rough estimate like ""2 months."" something i can work with."

1,"Hello everyone! First post here so sorry if anything is off.

I always worked out in my life, because I have a back problem and depression, so exercises helped me relieve my back pain and helped me stay happy. However I did pilates in a group of 4 people from 12 to 20 years old, and from 19 to 21 I started belly dancing classes and zumba, and I realised only then I didn't like working out with other people, so I quit everything and started working out alone at home. Everything was perfect until the pandemic came.

Before I woke up early, did my exercises (just dance, wii fit and solo workouts, varying each day), took a shower, breakfast and went to college/work. There were days when my laziness got the best out of me and I slept until I couldn't, but most days I was happy with that routine.

Now everyday seems a huge effort to get out of bed to do the exercises. I sleep until few minutes before class/work and eat breakfast while watching the professors and working. I really need tips on how to get motivated again to wake up early and do my routine. I'm starting to gain weight and I really don't want that after all my effort last year.

I get shin splints easily, I had only gone on walks then.

1,"My (25f) boyfriend (31m) hasn’t exercised in years due to back/health problems, and wasn’t super active apart from biking/skating before that. He’s really underweight and is challenged by 10 minutes of very basic exercises- (jumping jacks, dead bugs, hip hinges, squats.) His nutrition is really poor and he smokes.

I want to help him come up with a safe exercise routine so that he can build endurance, strength, and kickstart other healthy habits so he feels good. He doesn’t like feeling out of shape either and wants to make these changes. 

After a while the idea is to increase the exercise time and maybe see a doctor to do a full health evaluation, so for now, is it enough to do 10 minutes of the very basics until he can get through that? Should he do 10 minutes of basic exercises and follow it with a walk? Is it enough to start feeling a change after a month? 

He is the nicest guy and I really want him to experience feeling physically healthy and prevent any health problems now or down the road. I’ve played competitive sports my whole life so I also don’t want to push him too hard too fast. Thanks for any input!!

This might be a bit vague and unreasonable as well, but I wanted some advice. I have been working out pretty consistently for the last 3 weeks. I work out Sunday through Friday for about 1-2 hours. I do strictly cardio. Right now, its been exercise bikes on high resistance, 30 minutes on a stairmaster at about 60 steps per minute, but occasionally lowering it because I can get pretty tired. I also started using a rowing machine this week, and I like it. I also tried lifting weights for probably the first time in my life a couple days back, and I really pushed myself and felt awesome about it, but I have been SORE as hell the last two days so I haven't done it again yet. I likely will tomorrow.

Anyways, I am working out to lose weight so I can join the military. I started at 232 pounds, started dieting about 2 months ago, and working out the last two weeks. I am now at 218ish(it fluctuates by a couple pounds). I am trying to lose the weight as quickly as possible because I hate my lifestyle right now and have wanted to join the Army my whole life but never really did anything about it. So I have the following questions:

1)Is strictly cardio a bad idea? Should I also include muscle exercises regularly throughout the week?

2)Is doing cardio OTHER than running a bad idea? Will I find it easier to run the more cardio I do that ISN'T running, or do I need to run?

3)Is six days a week too much to work out? I have heard that I need recovery days so I picked Saturdays.

4)My heartrate will occasionally hit 190BPM and very rarely a little bit higher when I am pushing pretty hard. Is this dangerous or natural for my weight and inexperience?

That's about it. I know it's a lot. Any help would be much appreciated, and any extra advice as well. Thanks!",Am I going about losing weight correctly?,"Am I going about losing weight correctly?

23F- healthy BMI

Every time I do squats even with no weight my knees crack and crunch and then are in pain for a few days after. They hurt more than the burn of the squat!  And the sound and thought of them cracking really puts me off the squats too even if the real pain doesn’t come until afterward.

Since I was about 10 years old my knees have clicked every single time I straighten / bend my knees while lying or sitting down without fail . It’s impossible for me to straighten or bend my knees without them clicking. Idk if that’s relevant lol

Any help is Appreciated as although my weight is fine I’m a very physically weak and unfit person , I want to start some light exercises but this problem is putting me off doing anything at all except abs exercises and even then my knees will play up when I do the leg raises etc.

Since I was about 10 years old my knees have clicked every single time I straighten / bend my knees while lying or sitting down without fail . It’s impossible for me to straighten or bend my knees without them clicking. Idk if that’s relevant lol

Any help is Appreciated as although my weight is fine I’m a very physically weak and unfit person , I want to start some light exercises but this problem is putting me off doing anything at all except abs exercises and even then my knees will play up when I do the leg raises etc.

Sorry for the rant and all my complaining this is just really annoying me now as I can’t seem to do any YouTube exercise as smoothly as I should"

It has always been drilled into me that I need to train legs whenever I’m in an exercise routine but I am wondering whether it’s completely necessary.

I have big legs, they’re by far the strongest part of my body and I don’t want them to get any bigger. I have played soccer my whole life and still play today. I have also been overweight for most of my life so I’m sure they’ve gotten big carrying me around. 

On the other hand, my upper body is weak and would love to find more time at the gym to work on it. 

My current gym schedule is 2/3 times per week and I’m doing push/pull and legs with some core added in.

I am in no hurry to get a shape, I just want something that will keep me healthy in the remaining approximately 60 years of my life (I am 20f). So, I had the idea to start with something ridiculously easy the first day, but make it harder over time. An example would be to do 1 push up a day on days 1 and 2, and every other day I increse it by 1, so in a years time I would be doing more than 175 push ups a day, and I don't see how I would end up quitting. I can for example set a maximum, and once I hit that maximum I will stop increasing it. I am interested to see what peope think about this plan, and any tips you have. I have some specific questions as well:

1. Should I focus on just one thing like push ups, or should I have some variety? For example, let's say on a particlar day my ""number"" was at 30, then I could do 15 push ups and 15 sit ups for example.
2. Is it important that I spend some time in the beginning before starting figuring out how to do these exercises with the correct form? At the moment I am pretty much clueless about form for push ups, sit ups, etc.
3. Which exercise, or exercises, would you recommend I do? I don't have any specific goals like building muscle or anything, I just want to make sure I don't die early haha
4. What is a suitable maximum? I realise of course this depends on which exercise or exercises I choose to do
5. Should I take break days? Or perhaps days where I do less than usual? For example rather than going 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 22, 23, 23, 24, 24, etc. I could do 20, 10, 21, 10, 22, 11, 23, 11, 24, 12 etc.
6. I would prefer to pick something that is easy to just knock out whenever I want, like for example while I am cooking I could knock out a few push ups, then later in the day I could do another few, etc. Will it be fine to spread it throghout the day rather than doing it all in one session?

1,"Hi everybody,

I work out in my condo using a set of adjustable dumbbells and body weight exercises. I do pretty much only weights and zero cardio.

I find that during my workouts, I become completely exhausted to the point I feel I cannot continue within the first ~ 20 minutes of working out.

For example, today I did 10 sets of goblet squats with varying amounts of weight (body weight to bodyweight +50lbs), 3 sets of bodyweight lunges, and 2 sets of Bulgarian squats. By the time I was done all of this I felt sick to my stomach which seems unusual because it took me all of 25 minutes. I had to stop and go shower cause I didn't think I could do another squat.

I was wondering if this could indicate a deficiency, poor cardio health, or something else. Thank you for any information.

1,"Pretty much the title..Hello everyone, hope you are doing well!

I'm going to post a little background about myself and my fitness goals. I'll also post my concerns and what's holding me back from starting. Any advice for some or all of the categories will be greatly appreciated. Here goes:

What: I want to start with a realistic fitness goal.. nothing over the top. Probably 30 minutes for 4-5 days a week (as I imagine rest days are needed). I want to do a multiple, different exercises (a program, for example push ups, stretches of some sort, followed by lunges..I don't know) that require NO equipment (except the floor and walls). I also prefer to exercise alone. Speaking of no equipment...

Where: I prefer to do my exercises completely at home..hence, no gym equipment. The park is ok as well when the weather is nice. I just don't like gyms: the distance, the ambiance, the cost, the sweat on the equipment, thinking about where to store my stuff, the people (I'm somewhat antisocial..Hur Hur), it just does nothing for me.

How: This is where I need your help. I need your help as to which ""equipmentless"" exercises I can do at home. Perhaps 3 or 4 different types that I can do in a row for a grand total of 30 minutes?  

Desired result: I don't expect nor desire to be jacked (like the stereotypical bodybuilder). I suppose I want a lean or somewhat toned look if that makes sense. I'm currently skinny in both the arms legs (with legs being much stronger). I have a very slight gut, but I want it to be a least flat. In the end, I want to feel more energetic and stronger in the upper body/arms  (though I'll train the lower body too obviously). I'm a guy in his mid-twenties for context.

My experiences with exercise: My experiences have ranged from meh to mediocre/indifferent at best. In high school and college, I have tried various weight training programs with little reward. While I've achieved short term results while I was in enrolled in such programs, I wouldn't go back to the gym when the mandatory programs ended. I don't know..I just didn't enjoy using weight training equipment..I liked how I felt afterwards sometimes yeah..but it always felt like a chore . The coronavirus also doesn't encourage me to go to an enclosed space where everyone is rapidly breathing..no thanks.

Conversely, I plunged myself into Tai Chi for a short period and really enjoyed it. The reason I don't do it now is the lack of a structure or teacher (and being lazy).

The only current exercises I do regularly is long walks (everywhere..I have no car). I also stretch..but only for a few minute intervals when I need to feel better (after working on my computer for a while).

Things holding me back:

1) Too many choices and conflicting information: The number of exercises available is numerous. Worse still, the advice that follows is of often confusing and conflicts with other advice. Looking this shit up is mentally taxing. I'm also confused by the various definitions, methods, blalabla.

2) Diet modifications: I typically eat in moderation and avoid junk food..no problem there. I'm mostly concerned as to how much stuff I have to ADD if I start working out. Do I need to learn new recipes? How many servings of this or that? Do I simply add protein to the dishes I already know? Should I drink a protein powder (which is often expensive)? Ugh..

3) Lack of structure: I don't want to go to a gym.. maybe I can read your exercise suggestions and search them on YouTube. I don't want to half-ass it without knowing if it's getting me to my fitness goals or not. I also want suggestions for how many reps or sets for each exercise if possible.

4) I don't enjoy it: I'm trying to change this attitude..tai chi gave me this sense of hope. Perhaps other ""equipmentless"" exercises can do the same. I see the benefits, have genuinely enjoyed it a bit before..and wish to take the plunge. 

5) Fear of improper training: Lastly I fear that I'll exercise ""unevenly"" if that makes sense. I don't want to focus excessively on one muscle area over another as I risk the injury and akwardness that comes from an unevenly developed body (hence those skip a leg day jokes online). I don't know how much time or what exercises to dedicate to which part of the body..hench the confusing and conflicting information that come from the fitness world.

I have always eaten a lot of protein (meat, eggs and milk, as I live on a farm) so maybe that's another reason.

Today I felt dissatisfied with how low my heart rate was, so I switched to 4 mph at inclines from 3.5 to 5, with longer “active” intervals and shorter “rest” intervals over a 25-minute period. I’m not fit, so 4 mph is a jog for me, meaning this was considerably more intense. 

My peak heart rate for this exercise was about 40 to 50 bpm higher than my 60 minute one, and my average heart rate was about 30 bpm higher.

I was satisfied with that, but I was unsatisfied with the fact that I couldn’t keep that pace up for longer than a minute or two, and had to lower the intensity in broken, irregular intervals—mostly because something is wrong with my left leg that makes it tired very quickly when walking or running. 

Because of this, I was left conflicted. I wasn’t sure if I was pushing myself too hard or if I wasn’t pushing myself hard enough. Though I was tired and sweaty after the session, I still felt like I could keep going, and wanted to, but I’m not sure if that’s because I actually could or if it was just runner’s high.

I’m not quite sure what to do going forward, and was wondering if any cardio enthusiasts had any advice. Should I lower the intensity? Increase the duration?

So I’m pretty ashamed to admit this. Once Covid happened I completely stopped any form of exercise and also started working at home. I barely walk or move far at all. I worked a desk job before so it wasn’t a significant amount of movement but it definitely best staying home all day everyday. Today I walked 30 minutes for the first time in months. My back is extremely sore even hours afterwards from such light exercise. Is this normal? Will this go away the more consistently I walk? Or perhaps I may have a back problem?

1,"Hi. First time poster here. I am a 61 yr old woman, who, until recently, lead a very sedentary life. I owned an elliptical for year, used it rarely, and hated it every time. I finally sold it and got a treadmill. 
Since getting it over a month ago, I got the iFit app and have been using it religiously, only taking 1 day a week off. 
Recently, I've been doing a series of the Grand Canyon South Rim, down to the Colorado River, and back up to the top. I just finished part 9 of the series, and here is my take.
Today's interval training, going up the Grand Canyon, to the South Rim, from the Colorado River, was 19:46 minutes of pure sweat and hard work. It was an elevation gain of 219 feet, .86 of a mile, with an estimated calorie burn of 120. All of it was up hill, mostly a steep climb, in intervals of a normal walk, to a fast walk, 2/1 ratio. I did it though. I didn't slow down, or reduce the incline, but rather, was able to keep up with the trainer this time. It is part 9 of this series. I am not sure how many parts are in this series, but will continue for as long as I can, trying like hell to make it back up to the top.

I've read posts from other people doing 5+ mile hikes, and even longer and harder. But for me, someone who's barely exercised more than walking into the kitchen to get coffee, this is a huge thing. I've been doing this for over a month now, religiously, taking only 1 day a week off.

So far, my rounded total stats for my treadmill adventures are:

Total Miles: 41
Total elevation gain: 3,347
Total Estimated Calorie Burn: 4,401
Total Time: 16:19:08

Not gonna lie. I am proud of myself for changing my negative inner talk, only to once again fail. I am committed to continuing as long as I can, and making this a lifestyle of healthier living.

In the past few weeks I’ve found that during and after some exercises I feel great, strong, and energized.  During others I feel exhausted and totally wiped.

I started doing some research and I think that I might be doing too many sets.  I’m pretty inexperienced when it comes to exercise, so as I progressed, I simply increased reps and sets.  Now I’m thinking that’s not necessarily the correct method to gain muscle.  My regular exercise routine is:

Since xmas and partly due to stress during the pandemic... I've gained 8kg.

So a few weeks ago I started walking 2-3 times a day... I can't do much as I have a spinal problem as well as a major problem with one knee and a pretty knackered ankle... old injuries from soccer when I was in my teens and twenties that mean I can't run any more.

Since then I've increased my walks even more... I'm averaging 2.5 miles a day now and at an average speed of 3-4mph

I only got a yoga mat, 1/1.5/2kg dumbbells and some resistance bands. I have only little experience in exercising and just know the basic exercises like pushups, crunches. Im not able to do pull-ups right now because I got nothing to do it on.

I didn't really find anything good in the internet so far so I'm asking here for help. I also have a few questions:

* Do I have to change my eating habits to much protein and/or carbs? If yes what could you recommend for a 15 year old?
* Should I do a workout till I can't do it anymore(not till my muscles fail completely) or do it until I start to sweat?
* Should I do the reps all in one or take a break after 8-12 reps?
* Is it normal if I first lose weight?

1,"Heres some context. I'm 24 yo, 6'0"", 178 lbs, play sports here and there when there isnt a pandemic. But never worked out. Not bad, but I'm not in shape at all, just getting bailed by high metabolism/youth/idk I'm not knowledgeable on the topic.

Ive tried many times to be fit, but this time around I've done some actual research beyond ""good workout for biceps, calistentics"". Before I was doing like 5 or 6 random upper body exercises for 4 sets. Then the next day lower body/core. Then rinse and repeat for 6 days, taking sunday off. 

This didnt work, I wasnt tracking my progress, I had no idea what I was doing, no goal, no idea what exercises progress (like if I can do 5 million pushups, what's next?) When to add reps, sets, or move on to a more difficult exercise. Soon I became unmotivated, and I started doubting myself, thinking wow it's a month and a half and I see no results. Probably doing it wrong. 

I was impatient for sure, but I'm happy I was. I know I'm doing slightly better this time because my upper body exercises are split into Push &amp; Pull Days with the 3rd day being Core &amp; Legs. So Mon &amp; Thu Push, Tue &amp; Fri Pull, Wed &amp; Sat Core &amp; Legs. I was also running 3 miles on Wed and Sat.

My biggest issue right now is how much I'm struggling with (what feels like on paper) a small amount of exercise. 

My push days are 3 sets, 5 reps each as recommended by some fitness site.
Diamond Pushups, Dips, Pike Pushups, Decline Pushups, and Bench Dips. 

Pull is also 3 sets, 5 reps of Pullups, single leg deadlifts, chin ups, and upright prayer rows.

I started doing 5 of everything, and each week added 1 extra rep because I read progressive overload is important. However, I struggled doing this workout. Pretty much on the 2nd set I would start hitting failure at like 3 dips. After that I couldn't do any of my exercises completely. I'd stop half way, stretch my arms and barely finish. 

So my adjustment was to cut back everything to 5 and only add 1 rep to 1 exercise per week. And I started giving myself a 30 sec break to stretch my arms between every exercise. I still struggled so much, and it frustrated me. Am I just weak as shit? 

It annoys me because I feel like on paper my AB &amp; Core workout is the hardest. I do both in one session. 

Lower Body, 3 sets
15 Squats, 10 Glute Bridge, 15 Calf Raises, 15 Lunges, 5 Inchworm 

ABs 3 sets
25 Crunches, 45 secs Planks, 5 Knee Raise, 30 secs Russian Twists, 30 secs Plank Twists.

I feel so good doing these exercises. I sweat like crazy, I feel my abs burning, I reach a struggle each set (esp on the planks, last 10 secs my body shakes). But that struggle doesnt turn into failure. I'm progressing every exercise, and taking no breaks while doing a set. The struggle while being able to still finish feels like (in my head) what my upper body exercises should feel like.

TLDR - The difference in upper body exercise vs lower body/core. 

Upper Body - No momentum, constant breaks, once I struggle the workout declines so much its unmotivating, no progression being made because I can only do one set entirely correctly. Feel stiff but never sore.

Lower Body/Core - No breaks needed, get a good sweat, feel the muscles burning, feel sore after (for a couple hours, sometimes all day), feel good about myself once I complete it.

So what am I doing wrong? I cant go any lower in upper body exercises right? I'd be doing like 2 dips, 1 push up, lol do you even progress at that point? Any tips for me?

I recently sustained a serious injury (knee, already operated on and many months down the line) and I'm annoyed at myself for not seriously thinking it through before.

I personally found all the standard health/activity trackers like the average sports smart watch, (android) health apps, etc seem to not have, say, a section that takes into account an ""unusual"" situation. i.e. injury or say if you're a regular wheelchair user, you may not have a proper ""step count"". And you couldn't convince me without serious evidence that crutch use isn't as, if not more, intense as walking! 😅

1,"Hey, I like to follow exercise videos - normally HIIT and body-weight.

The problem I have found is that all, literally all, YouTube male-led exercise videos are done by the kind of wannabe 'alpha-male' noxious losers I would see at the gym.

Or remember seeing a video on ab exercises which was clearly done in this fellas mum's basement, sweating and cortorting and making exercise look like a particularly painful constipated shit by someone who is too focused on their faux-masculinity and not on being a well rounded individual. And there's a whole range of other faux-masculine nobends on YouTube that is forcing me to go watch the opposite sex, which is no bad thing. 

What I want is a set of decent videos by someone who is focused on results, maybe discusses the science about each video and seems like the kinda of fella who I would speak to in the pub.

So for a few months I've been walking on a treadmill for 30-45 min a day, and 3 weeks ago I made it so I walk an HOUR a day. I walk about 2 miles a day on my treadmill. 


I also am eating 1,200 calories a day. (I went to the doctor for a checkup and told her this- she had no issue with it. Don't worry). I've cut out most carbs and sugar, except for a very occasional toast or small serving of cereal. 


My mom said she doesn't want me to weight lift but maybe I can talk her into getting me some 5 pound weights so I can build some muscle? The gym isn't too far but my family is always busy so its not like she can just take me there every day. 


About a year ago I got an ultrasound on my throat to see if I had thyroid issues, and I also got blood work done. Both the blood work and ultrasound came back fine even though my neck looks big and I have issues losing weight. A few of my family members had issues so I easily could have them. (I'm saying this just so you know it might be harder for me). 


How do I lose weight super fast??? I literally hate my body so much even though I'm not even 200 lbs. I want to be skinnier every second of every day and it just makes me so upset. 


Obviously nobody can give me real medical advice. I just need basic info..

1,"Hello, I am a 35 yo female and I started working out and improving my diet about a year ago. It is mostly body weight exercises (isometric/calisthenic) and daily walking as I have very bad joints, but still I have been really happy with the visible results and have toned up all over. Except for the area above and below my belly button, the very middle of my abs. It seems to be just a loose layer of fat I just cannot get rid of, when I do push-ups with core tight it actually hangs down a bit and is really embarrassing. I know there's no such thing as spot targeting but I would welcome any tips or moves that may help. As far as my diet, I have eliminated caffeine, alcohol, added sugars, white/simple carbs, most gluten and dairy.

1,"So about 2 months ago, I (34F) had some kind of cardiac episode that my heart rate spiked to 180bpm+ while I was driving and I had to pull over and have and ambulance take me to the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack.

1,"My mom is 64 and has hypertension. She could afford to lose 20 pounds, but has a busted knee that is holding her back.

She has full control of her knee and it flexes well, but has fluid in her knee due to busting something in there. We live in Spain and the doctors are telling her she’s still too young for knee surgery (I don’t know what the hell they’re waiting for; a miracle?).

When we go out for walks she starts to experience pain in her knee around the ten minute mark. She’s a fighter through and through so you won’t hear her complaining, but I know she’s in pain. She has developed a bit of a limp due to this.

She does enjoy going out on bike rides. However, we use the city’s electric bikes because they’re softer on her knee, so I don’t know that it’s really putting a dent on the weight loss since it’s mostly riding for leisure. I know any bit of activity is good, but she only gets to ride on her free days as she does 24 hour shifts at the clinics she works in. At work, she isn’t on her feet all the time, and she isn’t busy all the time, she’s just on call for whatever patient needs tending to. This gives her plenty of free time to do SOMETHING in her private room to keep her weight under control.

Yoga and running are mostly out of the picture, as most of the poses put a lot of stress on her bad knee and my mom wouldn’t be able to kneel for child’s pose much less assume a table top position or transition to downward dog; and running or walking would just aggravate her knee even more.

Swimming is a nice option but again, I need to show her something she can do every day and not just on her free days. 

My main goals for her are: weight loss and avoid further aggravation of the busted knee.

I love my mom and I want to see her get better. Losing weight would also lift her self esteem and she deserves to feel happy about herself.

If anyone here can recommend any exercises that can work around her limitations I’d appreciate it very much.

1," So she was out of the pool from late March through mid-July, and like the rest of us, was a bit of a lazy slug. Got out of conditioning, put on 8-10 pounds. Coach found a local pool in a park they could use, and so they resumed practices for 4-5 weeks in mid-July through a couple of weeks ago, plus we started watching more what we were eating, and she did lose a few pounds (She is right now about 5' 6.5"", 130 - she was about 135). But that pool closed a week or two ago. So we started jogging

My daughter goes back to swimming in a few  weeks, and Coach has demanded that all the girls keep a regular exercise  regimen, so I'm having her do short distance running: miles and  5Ks. Problem is, she's a bit out of condition, and she has no real technique/form for running. I don't even know how to give her a good pre-run stretch routine, or how to monitor if what she is doing is  optimal in terms of pace, stride, and minimizing the impact on her  knees, hips, and back. 

She  did a 5K three days ago, and she was miserable the last 1/3 of  it. Like wailing in discomfort. But to her credit, she did not stop and  never slowed to a walk, and she ended up with a not-great-but-not  terrible time (average about a 10:40 mile, I think it was around 32:57 -  I'd like to get that down below 30:00, preferably below 28:00, which  would be a 9-minute mile pace). She said her chest was hurting, she had trouble breathing, she kept feeling like she was going to puke, towards the end anyway. She got some side stitches, but those went away. I was happy-ish with her 32:57, because 5 months ago, I had her run a 5K just to see if she could still do it (I figured for a competitive swimmer, it would be easy) but she ran a dismal 35:31. So I was happy with the big improvement the other day. 

The day before yesterday, I took her out  for a mile - which I figured would be super easy -  and she clocked a not-so-hot, but decent for her, 8:44 (if I  remember correctly). And again, she struggled with pain. of course, she was not pacing herself as gently as she tried to do for the 5K, but she can swim 400m (500y), so I figured jogging a mile would be a breeze. I guess not? 

I mean... Her  times are decent times for a kid off the street, but not for a  competitive swimmer who needs stamina. So I need (she needs) an expert's  help 🙂

She has never enjoyed exercise, and she doesn't even enjoy swim practice all that much. She is the typical teen with multiple devices and distractions, and would be a couch potato if I didn't threaten her to get off her butt. Today I told her to get ready for her run, and she plopped down on her bed and played dead. But I know that most of it is because her stamp is such that she knows, going into each run, that it will be unpleasant. And that once she got into better shape and running a 5K was less demanding of her, she wouldn't mind it - just strap on her music player and go.

There are a handful of these items in stores and online, but there isn’t a lot of marketing towards them. 

Are there benefits to using these types of masks? Does it actually improve performance? Or am I potentially slowly strangling myself?"

So  I am now monitoring my waist. I am 1.84 (at the higher end of 6'0'' but  feet and inches are less accurate than cm and ml). Blood work is  health, not cholesterol, muscle mass is ok (not a gym buff by any  means), and I do have a small beer belly which is expected for a 41 yo  man. The belly is more noticeable when sitting down but if you see me  standing you will say I am actually skinny.

Having  said all that my waist is 95cm which is on the border. I'm looking at  this one chart and they say a 6'0'' man can have a 75cm waist and be  healthy. I really don't think so. They will be deemed a freak if they  ever existed. This body frame simply does not exist (someone with 75 cm  waist and 185 cm high - the hips will be too narrow.)

\- how accurate are these charts?

I've been going to the gym every day, I'm getting good at making music, I listen to ppl like Alan Watts and David Foster Wallace all day to help me understand my situation better. But with that greater awareness comes a deep well of inescapable sadness that sucks the life and energy out of me. Because the reason why I'm doing it all is for those around me. But the problem is that I am alone. And it's my fault that I'm alone. I've pushed everyone away because I've just been hurt by friends, family, and everyone else over and over again. But here's the real issue: my environment. No matter how much I improve myself will fix the world around me. Did you know our society is completely backwards? The reason our species can display such intelligence but also barbarism is because our development was easily won. The planet supports human life perfectly. Hunter gatherer tribes collected some crazy variety of nutrients that people nowadays don't get anymore. Agriculture was basically a stupid fucking idea which a few of the shittiest members of our species used to create capitol and enslave the rest of the world. Thats what we mostly are. Slaves to money and impulses and those are both controlled by very few people. There's no way to argue against that anymore. A few people have all the money in the world while there are others starving in the streets. And everyone else just tries to be content with what little they have. And all of it reflects in us. I spend most of every day working a pointless job making money for the few people who are literally killing the planet. And I come home to my sad mother. When I look in the mirror I see someone strong and beautiful and brave. And its going to waste because I also see a history of bad men. We're not lazy or stupid. We're strongly affected by the shitty actions of others who we have no control over. Our society is a deadly waste of time and it will end some day because of that. As will I and my role in it. The reason I know all of this is because, when I'm at my worst, the only thing that gives me strength is the chance to see all the people I love smile again. But I feel as though I never will.

1,"My wife and I had a newborn and it's really hard to get out there or exercise for long stretches. 

I'm hoping to find a stationary, upright exercise bike that people could recommend- that can handle some heavy duty workouts (nothing Too crazy, obviously) in the tv room as we hang out together. We have cats and soon will have a toddler so it'll have to be safe. 

I'm just so out of my element and it's difficult to see what bikes could fit my needs, be adjustable enough (I'm 5'6 and want to be able to almost extend my legs obviously on it), and be of decent quality. I don't have the money to spend $500 plus but maybe $350 or less would work. Any ideas ?? Thank you!!","Could anyone recommend a decent at home, upright, exercise bike that won't break the bank?

1,"Okay I’ve been trying to find the answer online but there seems to be a lot of contradicting information, so I figured I would just post about my specific situation.

I’m super unfit. Well, I must be. I have a normal BMI, but before two weeks ago, I never used my muscles or my cardiovascular system for anything other than walking around the house. 

Then two weeks ago I started doing home workouts, mostly leg and butt exercises. The first time I did it, I was super sore for the next two days. On the fourth day, I did it again, and I felt only a little sore. After that I worked out my legs/butt every other day, and I haven’t really felt sore since. I haven’t added resistance bands/weights to my workouts, but I have increased the number of reps.

So, my question is, am I doing something wrong? Do I need to add resistance/weight already? It seems odd to me that my muscles would get stronger after only two workouts, especially since I consider myself very weak, so I feel like I must be doing something wrong.","If my muscles aren’t sore after working out, am I still getting any benefits?","If my muscles aren’t sore after working out, am I still getting any benefits?

So, I' started eating healthy and working out from May. I have a history of eating disorder and PCOS ( I've been taking medications).

I've been patient all [along.](https://along.in/) In July, I had my periods for almost a month so I wasn't able to do much. I started on medication from august 4. And I've lost around 9 kg. I am super proud of myself, Because I was a mess last year. I'm in a much better place now!

Okay now coming to the point, at the beginning of May I used to do a lot of cardio. Then, I slowly started doing resistance training with the resistance band, and Now I've finally got weights (5kg Dumbbells) and I'm loving it. I also walk 10k steps (one and a half hour). I try to do weight training with dumbbells for an hour. I try to eat around 1400-1500 a day. I've been very disciplined when it comes to my diet :)

It's been nearly 3-4 days. My weight is literally not moving. I honestly don't know what to do. I feel so unmotivated now :/ Maybe I'm not doing enough? Is there any way to break this plateau :/","Reached Plateau, HELP :(","Reached Plateau, HELP :( 22/F, SW-97.6kg, CW-88.8kg, GW-57kg

I keep thinking to myself, ""if i diet and lose a little weight, it'll be much easier to exercise!"".... but I've been yo-yoing with the same 30ish lbs for the past 3 years.  and then I get a depressed and eat myself back into my heavier weights and have to start all over again.

Do you think it is possible to expand the lung capacity through deep breathing?

I take as deep of a breath I can through my nose, then gradually add more and more air through my mouth by sucking the air in by the corner of my mouth, then shut the lips and swallow air down. This way I am able to fill the lungs up really full. When I can't fit any more I just keep it in for a while.

One could think this method would ""stretch"" the lungs out, or at least make them used to be filled up so you could maybe hold your breath longer or increase breathing capabilities during cardio etc.",Increase lung capacity through deep breathing?,"Increase lung capacity through deep breathing?

1,"Hey folks,

I (17M) am considering doing the above for 30 days to see if I can get some definition in my core/ upper torso and arms. As background, I am 1.82 metres tall and weigh 60kg. I am underweight, although not by much, and have never exercised like this before in my life. I am a pretty decent runner, and can run 5km no problem in about 20 minutes, no breaks. I started doing both exercises today, and got through 1 minute of plank no problem. I did 20 consecutive push ups in maybe around 40 seconds, and then took a 10 second break, did another 10 push ups, took another 10 second break, did another 10, and then took 20 second breaks and did 4 more sets of 5 push ups until I got to 60 push ups. All in I don’t think that’s too bad for someone who never does this type of exercise. 

So the question at hand. I am not asking for instant abs, or huge arms, my arms aren’t terrible as it stands, but they are not at all defined. I have a flat stomach, but again, not at all defined. So I am asking here if the above workout every day for a month or so would get me some definition in the mentioned areas, even if only a little, but still a noticeable amount?

1,"I've gotten more and more into grip Training this year, while I thought my functional fitness training would aid in my grip strength I've learnt that to do more pull ups and to train myself up to the one arm fingertip plank I need to focus more on specific grip Training.

I'm not reinventing the wheel you can find everything online but haven't seen many posts on grip Training and forearm mass on this forum. 

There is a major advantage to having great grip strength, your grip is the last thing to go, ever shake hands with an older gentlemen and think damn are you shaking my hand hard on purpose ?? Take it easy. 

It also can help adding more reps to your pull ups and push ups, building up great strength endurance, or it can help with your jujitsu or wrestling.

Ever shake hands with a wrestler ? They are one of  most powerful athlete's out there. Alot of boxers back in the golden days of Jack Dempsey use to train grip/forearm  Training regularly, he was one of the hardest hitters of all time along with Rocky Marciano who put a boxer in a coma for awhile with his powerful punches.

This is something I wish I would of trained more when. I first started bodyweight training, but better late then never try not to rush through the progressions slow and steady wins the race 

Push guide 
First progressing 
Knee push ups on knuckles (pronated position) 
Knee push ups on knuckles (neutral position) 
Do 2 sets of 20 on each exercise, once you have comfortably completed all reps and sets go on to the  next progression 

2nd progression 
standing fingertip push ups
Stand against the wall with your fingertips extended 
For best results aim for a 3 second tempo while in the flexion position then press away. 
2 sets of 40 reps. 

3rd progression 
Vertical fingertip push up 
Put yourself in the pike push up position but extend your legs a bit further then a standerd pike push up see where your most comfortable extend your fingertips and proceed to do the pike push ups with your fingers extended. 
2 sets of 20 

4th progression 
Fingertip push ups on knees 
Standard push ups  elbows close to your body but again extend your fingers and proceed to do push ups 
2 sets of 20 

5th progression 
Fingertip plank 
Hold the plank for 1 min for 5 sets add 30 secs to your plank every week until you can get to 4 mins each plank 

6th progression 
One arm finger tip plank 
Hold as long as you can and build from there it's a very difficult feat to hold for a minute from here sky's is the limit for you.


pull progressions 

1st progression 
Standing row hang 
Best on a post hold the post with your fingertips and pull back griping the post with all your strength using your finger tips. Hold for 1 minute 8 sets 

2nd progression inverted/Australian row hang 
Hang for 2 minutes while keeping your body straight and core on 

3rd progression bar hang
Grip onto the bar and just hang once you feel your forearms starting to burn acivate your shoulders and bring scapula down just like a scapula pull hold for 2 minutes 6 sets 

One arm hangs 
Same as above but with one arm hold for as long as possible then switch sky's the limit when you reach this progression hey it might help you achieve the one arm pull up an extremely great feat to pull off 

Good luck

Seeing results in a short amount of time in really important because it keeps you motivated.

A rewarding thing to hear is when a client says they got a compliment from other people noticing their body changes. Although it's good to be toned, there's other benefits you'll get. Other areas of your life like work and leisure can improve.

When it comes to body toning, you're looking at working the muscles, getting your heart rate high, and keeping controlled meal sizes. The better you do and the more effort you put into doing these things, the quicker you'll see changes in the mirror.

Initially you need to be patient for a few weeks and put in the work. This is why I created my online coaching platform. It keeps you going in those first few weeks while you might not see changes instantly. This is the time that most people either give up, or lose hope, or put in less effort.

I track clients progress, and make sure they're completing the exercises with quality. My online platform and coaching techniques allows me to do this. And that's how you're going to see changes. You'll be energized to push yourself hard.

However, I definitely lack the knowledge to be able to say that I know what I'm doing... because I don't. Does anyone here have any experiences in exercising whilst having disorders/sicknesses? I'd love to know if I should be avoiding certain things.

Thanks for the help to whoever replies! ❤️❤️"

1,"Hi everyone,

I [M20] have been lifting weights for about 3 straight years. The past year I had discovered I had DDD and Schmorl’s nodes, lose of height I  discs and have sharp pains in my lower lumbar region. I, and my doctor, have concluded this hat I can no longer lift heavy weights, even lightweights can hurt with certain exercises. I would love to stay active and quite frankly I get depressed and more anxious without weights. I have been running for the past 6 months without it disturbing my back too much, which is so great. But, jogging will take a toll on your back eventually as well. I believe light weights on machines are another option and a preferred one if true. No more axial loading exercises as well. Anyways, as my title asks, are there any gyms that primarily have clean lightweight machines? Cheap ones at that? I’m in mid Florida. Any other comments regarding similar experiences or suggestions are welcome as well. Thanks in advance.","Is there a gym with primarily machines? - cheap, clean, primarily lightweight machines","Is there a gym with primarily machines? - cheap, clean, primarily lightweight machines Hi everyone,

Hi, I’m doing research for my PhD into how weight loss issues can affect mental health. I would really appreciate it if you could fill in this questionnaire which should take about 10 minutes. All the questions are multiple choice so it’s very easy to complete and you don’t need to to write anything. You’ll only need to give a first name and your answers will be anonymised. You can also withdraw from the survey at any time.

The more responses I can get the more accurate the data will be which is really helpful:) I hope this research will help to bring mental and physical treatments closer together which I believe can only be a step in the right direction.

I'm a very small (4'11) 23F and I haven't done any kind of exercise in a very long time. I notice the lack of exercise is affecting my mind and my body. I feel like lately my muscles are losing their strenght and power. Since I'm in a bad place atm it's been difficult to get motivated to exercise. For example, the only time I have to work out is in the mornings and I can't do mornings because I have trouble getting out of bed for that purpose.


My question goes in two categories:

* Which exercises are good to start to get more ""in shape"" without really leaving my home (bc of covid)?? I heard skipping rope is good.

* What is a good way to motivate myself to get out of bed and do exercise?? 

*I thought of a third question: any good online exercise programs or apps?

1,"I used to be a really skinny kid. Like, 5'8"" and graduated high school at 140 lbs. Gained some weight in college and ended at around 5'9"" and 165 with regular gym time my final semester. Then, I got really sad my first year of graduate school, stopped working out, started eating and lounging more, and ended up around 190ish when the second year rolled around.

We meet at a local park for our workout and not at a gym, where he brings some equipment (t-Rex strap, an 8kg weight and mattress for some exercises).

My diet is compromised with the same meals every day in order to make it simple for me, I log them into the “MyFitnessPal” app and at the end of the day I send him a screenshot of the daily summary.

My diet

Morning:
- Salad (cucumber &amp; gamba)
- Egg
- Cottage (5% / 3%)
- Protein drink

Afternoon
- About 2 chicken breasts
- Couscous
- Kebab

Evening
- Sandwich (whole wheat bread &amp; yellow cheese)
- Tuna

1,"Hi all, I've been incorporating swimming in to my exercise routine for about 6 weeks. I swim at a lake (always with a buddy) once a week and typically cover about 1.5 - 2 km per swim. I swim at a reasonable clip but if doing 2 km it usually takes me about 45 - 50 minutes. I usually tack on about 15 extra minutes of treading water in the middle of the lake. This summer's the first time I would say I swim regularly since at least 14 years ago.

In addition to swimming, I do some combination of a 5 - 10k run, HIIT and resistance training 4 days a week. I would say my fitness level is good. I'm 32F, 5'7 and 140 lbs.

Here's my question: how do I combat the INSANE exhaustion I get after swimming? I was tired to the point of nausea last night after my swim, and all day today I've been groggy and a little cranky. I have felt this way the last couple of times I've gone for a swim so I planned in advance to drink lots of (non lake) water during the day, I always coat myself in sunscreen... but today I am so tired today that walking the dog was a challenge let alone another full workout.

Due to Covid, I haven’t been as active as I’d like. So I started playing this game and I only played for 13 minutes, but I did a lot of squats.

It hurts to lower myself into a sitting position and when I lay down, I can feel the pain too but not as bad when I’m lowering myself to sit. Laying down, I’m just aware of the soreness.

1,"Please be kind because I’m really proud of myself☺️

I’m on the really heavy side of life-a combination of 44G (UK) boobs that I struggle to find a decent sports bra for, a knee injury from playing football at 15, and a pretty bad smoking habit.... Pre-knee-injury I’d walk to and from school 1.5 miles each way, do a 12 mile run every other day, weight train on alternate days to running, as well as football training 4-6pm Wednesday and Thursday, with matches on Tuesdays and Sundays. 

When I damaged my knee, my doctor refused to refer me for tests, saying it was just a sprain (18 years later I still have a heavy limp, can’t do stairs without pulling myself up, or go down stairs without my knee giving way- now written off by doctors as due to my size) meaning I had to pretty much give up all my training overnight... I did not, however, stop any of the rather large calorie intake until about 4/5 years later. Aside from a halfhearted attempt at going to the gym once a week a few years ago, not much has been going exercise wise for me lately... As a result I am huge. 5’8 and 25stone. I don’t have a problem being huge, but I also wouldn’t have a problem being smaller or at least a little bit fitter. 

So... My friend lost her mum last year, and decided during lockdown to start running a couch to 5k in the hopes of doing a charity ‘marathon in a month’ kind of thing in her memory. I’ve been watching her progress over the past few weeks and she’s done great, and raised double what she wanted to raise. She told me she didn’t think she could do it, as she has worse fitness levels than me (I walk 2 miles to work everyday whereas she drives everywhere) so I’ve been telling her how proud of her I am every opportunity I get. 

What she doesn’t realise is that she’s been inspiring me to do something a bit more exercise wise. I’ve been walking to a shop further away than my local, getting off my bus home a stop early, walking round the local streets listening to ZombiesRun! on my lunch break, little things like that.... 

But TONIGHT!!! I got home from work after a crappy 13hour shift, and saw her latest update. 24.5 miles. She’s now aiming for 40 miles by the end of the month!! I am so fantastically proud of her I’m beaming at my phone. I realise that if she can do something as amazing as that, I can push myself a little bit harder too! 

I pull out my trainers, dust off my not-very-used gym knee brace, pull on my chest binder (literally the only thing that stops me getting black eyes when doing anything more than a slow walk) and drag out my brothers ex’s copy of the Insanity workout from behind all my other DVDs. 

Instant regret! I’m sweating from pulling on my binder for goodness sake, what am I doing attempting the fit test of the Insanity workout?!? Then I realise that actually, I’m doing ok. I haven’t missed any of the exercises, and ok they aren’t perfect due to my size (seriously, they need to do a fat person version because those skinny gits obviously don’t need to be doing this!! I don’t see them trying to do Spider-Man’s or jumping jacks with a massive belly in the way!!) but I’m managing to do at least one or two of each one, with the exception of the burpees-I don’t think my knee would like me tomorrow if I attempted them, and I have a 10 hour shift lol. Every time I start slowing down, I think of my friend and how she’s doing.... Couch. 5K. 5miles. 10miles. How proud of her I am at every milestone. How proud of me she would be knowing I’m at least trying. It spurs me on to try and finish the fit test. 

I managed to do over half an hour of intense exercise. I’m sweating, wheezing, red in the face, I’m aching from muscles I’d forgotten I had, and coughing up half a lung from the 15 a day habit. I did every single exercise to the best of my ability. I had to stop a few times because I pushed myself too hard, but I got through it. 

There’s not going to be a happy ever after with this story. It’s not that kind of story. But I’ve spent at least 10 years thinking I can’t push myself to lose a bit of weight, or get a bit fitter; restricting myself because I don’t have a gym buddy, can’t afford the gym, too far from the outdoor gym, my knee won’t hold up, and all the other rubbish excuses I’ve made over the years. 

I’m not promising anyone, especially myself, that I’ll do the whole Insanity programme; but maybe I’ll do the fit test every couple of days. Maybe I’ll end up doing it every night. All I know is, despite currently wheezing from smoking too much, and the random muscle spasms from under-used muscles, I feel great. I feel like for the first time in a long time I feel like I can take control of my own fitness. And I owe it all to my friend who wanted to raise a little money for charity. ☺️",First exercise in 10 years!!,"First exercise in 10 years!! Please be kind because I’m really proud of myself☺️

So when I got home, I was bragging to my husband about how much I'd improved and that the dogs were holding me back, perhaps I should try going for an actual run without the dog, I reckon I'd be able to handle it, no worries!

Spoiler alert: I could not handle it.

I set off today, started at a brisk walk to warm up, then when I crossed the highway I started jogging. I was determined to jog for a solid 10 minutes, how hard could it be? 

60 seconds in and I'm gasping like an asthmatic giraffe that needs to sneeze. 3 minutes in and I have to pause to vomit. The next 3 minutes I have so much saliva flooding my mouth and due to the aforementioned gasping, every time I try and breathe in, I'm choking on my own spit. I interchange 30 seconds of jogging with 30 seconds of brisk walking.

There's sweat pouring off me and I can feel my face is redder than it has any right to be.

At the 10 minute mark I turn and powerwalk home. My husband starts laughing as soon as I make it inside. I collapse face first on the floor rug and decide, nope, definitely not there yet!

0,"For those of you that do not know, a fruitarian diet consists of 50% raw fruit, sometimes even more, as high as 75%!!!!!! Fruitarians should consider becoming a normal vegan because their current diet is completely useless.

A lot of people love to spread misinformation and say that the fruitarian diet is amazing for health. No, it is not, it is terrible, there is nothing good about this diet, it is as bad, if not worse than the standard American diet! Let's take a look at common issues with the fruit diet. This post does not even cover all of the problems, by the way, and a vegan diet still requires a lot of research to be done safely.

1) Iron. Iron is an essential micro nutrient that is, in a vegan diet, typically found in dark green vegetables (cooked spinach is one of the best sources), chia seeds (a great source when you consider there is the secondary benefit of omega 3), whole grain cereals that have been fortified, beans and legumes. As you can see, none of these things are a fruit, and if you are a women, there is almost no chance you can get enough iron on a fruitarian diet.

2) Zinc. This mineral is not really something you will typically see in fruits. Legumes, nuts, seeds, oats and tofu and examples of great sources, yet none of these are fruits. And before you mention avocadoes, note that it is nutritionally closer to a vegetable than to a fruit.

3) Calcium. This essential mineral is also another case of something that you will almost never find in fruits. Dark green vegetables, beans, chia seeds and a lot of other fruits all contain more calcium that any fruit could ever dream of.

4) Proteins. This macronutrient is very rare in fruits, but even if it is present, it will not be bioavailable: the body needs some amino acids to digest them, which would not be a problem with a standard vegan diet if you pair your foods carefully. You might start losing weight, but a lot of it will be muscle, not fat, for this reason. Your protein intake is going to be very limited.

5) Vitamin D. Fruits do not contain it at all, so during winter you will have very little vitamin D.

6) Essential fats. None of them can be found in fruits. You will need to get omega 3 and 6 elsewhere. Because so much of your diet is fruits, you barely get any healthy fat. 

7) You will get way too many carbohydrates. The sugar found in fruits typically goes to the liver, which is fine when they are eaten as part of a balanced meal plan (25-30% of your diet would be fruits), which is not the case here, there is a huge amount of sugar and the liver &amp; pancreas will suffer a lot. 

8) Vitamin B12. Fruits are not fortified with it, and you already have so many other nutrients to worry about, and now on top of that you need to eat fortified foods?

""But can't I just supplement everything?"" No, not really. The human body is very complex and the science of nutrition is not really understood that well, and supplements fail to recreate the chemistry in foods that our body is used to digest. Taking one supplement will often block the absorption of another nutrient, for example calcium supplements are harmful to the absorption of iron. Another example is that a vitamin C pill does not reduce the risk of cancer while eating vitamin C rich foods like kiwi does, which shows how important the interactions of the elements in foods that we do not understand are. Also, there are cases in which people simply cannot absorb supplements properly due to health issues. Overall, having your vitamins and minerals from food is just so much better.

""But since only 50%-75% of the diet is fruits, I can eat other things and avoid the deficiencies you described."" Not really, you have a lot of things to worry about, so if you stick to a true frutarian diet, you will almost certainly be able to get all of the needed nutrients with the little food you have left that is not fruits. Afterall, fruits are pretty much never the solution to any of the lacking nutrients in a vegan diet. Neither iron, zinc, calcium, proteins, essential fats, vitamin b12, vitamin D, will be found in fruits. 

Think about it this way. A typical vegan diet typically only has a moderate amount of fruit servings, yet most vegans fail to keep it long term without deficiencies, and the majority of their diet (fortified foods, dark greens, legumes) contains quite a bit of the nutrients that are commonly lacking, so if the backbone of your diet a plant type that has none of the commonly needed nutrients in a vegan diet, I believe you will likely run into trouble.",Debunking the fruitarian diet,"Debunking the fruitarian diet For those of you that do not know, a fruitarian diet consists of 50% raw fruit, sometimes even more, as high as 75%!!!!!!

Also, while bulking if the plan is to be on a +400kcal surplus each day, but I went +100kcal on six days and ate the rest +2800 on the seventh day, would i get the same results as doing the same surplus every day?

I know that one day or one night of binge eating isn’t gonna ruin this whole process and ofc im gonna be back on track from tomorrow but still, i just dont feel good about myself rn and i dont know what to do. Any tips? Thank you:)"

I'm trying to get a sodium:potassium ratio of 1:2 at least, or 1:3 even. I used to get about 1600mg sodium and 4700mg potassium but I've done research and low sodium is unhealthy.

S (9m): skinny, but not underweight. 

L (6f): underweight and suffering from encopresis, she really needs a high-fiber diet. 

D is just 7 weeks old, so there's nothing but formula on the menu for him. At least that's easily decided :)

I’ve set my calories at 2,796 but some days I may eat closer to 3,000. I know FitBit can be off, so do you think I’m safe by allowing a 1,000 calories swing in burn.

After I was kinda worried since I didn't know what other vegetable I might like 😅 I tried these turnip oven fries I made, but honestly it's not really the taste that bugs me, it's the texture 100%. Really soft, slimey, and dense, not fluffy like a regular french fry. Despite how long they cooked and clearly looked crisp on the outside.  So I think that's a no go.

I was gonna attempt yuca and cassava, but uh...just looking those up kinda scared me since apparently they have cyanide in them. Cassava more than yuca. From what I researched cassava has to be soaked and washed waaay longer than yuca. 

I was tempted with brussel sprouts but I'm scared of those since even my older brother doesn't like them 😂 it's kinda hard trying to find what non starchy vegetables in my diet I'll like.

Hello... So I recently (2 months ago) decided I want to change my body for good. I'm 31M, 5'10"" 225 lbs and I'm eating at a 300-500 cal deficit right now.

This screenshot is of one full day eating pretty much as best as I can right now (best that I feel comfortable and satisfied with currently). Like 3 full cooked meals, every single ingredient that entered my body. Everything weighed and properly added to the app. So I want to understand the nutrients more......

How am I doing with nutrients so far from what you can see for my body? What do I need more of? How can I reduce sodium.... I've literally been over the sodium recommendation on the app every single day since I downloaded it I think. I feel like its impossible to lower my sodium. I am eating regular foods that everyone eats, I dont know why its always so much sodium... Is it okay that my carbs are a bit low? Is my fat too high? Is the protein good enough? I don't know how I can even get more protein. I am eating protein every meal (eggs breakfast, flank steak lunch, ground beef dinner). What you see in this screenshot is 2000 cals~.

0,"Hey all.

I'm underweight, always has been, but did gain quite a bit of weight when I started to excercise in my early 20's, and started to eat more as well. For awhile I felt GREAT.

Due to things and stuff, I lost mh excercise routine and started eating less naturally again. I've tried so many times to get back into excercise of the last few years (28 years old at the moment) but I awalys, fail, partly because I'm an so damn tired, which probably is due to the fact that I don't eat as much. A few problems is that I am a very picky eater (always has been, getting better but there's still so many things I just can't eat, and I hate it), I have a naturally low appetite I guess (I don't snack much during workdays as I'm busy doing stuff, only if I'm doing nothing I want to snack), and I get full quickly so IF I snack I'll probably eat less when I have a main meal... I tried calorie counting for like a week a couple of years ago but stopped as it was too time consuming, but I remember it definitely wasn't enough for weight gain). 

I have been thinking about food replacement drinks, but most are advertised as weight loss, like ""this will fill you up but is only 100 calories"" or w/e which is obviously the opposite of what I want. Is there similar products that are not as filling? I've seen protein companies do ""weight gain"" blends but the usually contain whey which I (suprise suprise) don't like. Only protein drink I can stomach is Clear Whey and honestly even that is a struggle. But at the same time, I can't eat anything ""dry"", even when eating normal meals I need to drink between every bite essentially (which also means I fill up more quickly). 

So, tldr, how to gain weight in a healthy way when you don't want to eat for like a multitude of reasons? I'd love to speak to a mental health professional or diatrician about this ofc, but that's not possible atleast in the short run, maybe in a few years if I'm lucky.

1. I feel hungry and like 1-5 bites later i feel full 2. I eat like normally and around halfway through my meal i get super full all off a sudden.

0,"Hey so I am using myfitnesspal and tracking steps for the first time and its saying it gives me 242 more calories since I did a walk. Does that mean I should eat 242 more calories so I can keep my normal calorie deficit?

I'm usually 300-500 cal deficit but now that I see the walking is allowing me more calories, should I be eating more?

For example I just went shopping and walked 5k steps and says it burned 242 cals, but I'm already doing a 300~ cal deficit just on diet alone. So if I dont eat an extra 242 cals from that walking does that mean I'm at 542 cal deficit? What if I do like 15k steps, then my deficit would be well over 500? Should I try not to go below 500 cal deficit with exercise included, or just go based on what the app says is my recommended calories?

0,"I'm 25 years old, female, about 4'11"", 97lb but my diet is not great. The main issue is I eat too much fast food. I usually eat fast food or other unhealthy meals (e.g. chicken schnitzel sandwich) 2 - 3 times per week.

When I was a kid, my parents didn't really cook or feed me properly, so I ended up eating a lot of simple things that a kid can make (toast, noodles, cereal, microwaved chicken nuggets etc) so I grew up nutrient deficient. As a result, I'm also a picky eater because I just didn't have exposure to many different foods.

However I've been working on it and have been trying new foods, especially vegetables.

Recently I started getting HelloFresh every few weeks, mostly to try new foods and get inspiration for different meals.

It helped for a while, although I was still eating fast food at least once a week.

I think the main problems are:

* Cravings; \*especially\* if I let myself get too hungry and feel too weak to cook something or the craving for something salty/sugary is too strong. It can be hard to avoid going without food at times. Sometimes I'm too wrapped up in work before I realise I'm hungry.
* Accessibility and ease; it's just easy for me to go to the drive through or even walk down stairs to a cafe (I live in the city) and order something versus cooking something.
   * Even when I have a meal prepped and ready to heat up, I just have strong cravings to get fast food.

The worst part is, I don't even like most of the fast food that I eat. It tastes ok, but it makes me feel fat, gross, sick. I know it's not good for me. But I struggle with cravings and give in too much. I'm basically addicted to it. I'm concerned about my health, especially heart health. I exercise regularly, and obviously I'm not even close to being overweight, but I'm afraid I'm on the path there and I'm struggling to control my cravings.

0,The only reason keto works is because you're  limited to filling foods. example if you ate 1000 calories in chips vs 1000 calories in ground beef what will keep you full all day yup the ground beef.  Why because its dense and has lots of fats and protein keeping you full lessening the desire to eat and guess what ground beef is keto. But the thing is if you eat 3 pounds of it wanna know what's gonna happen you're gonna gain weight the only reason keto works is because the majority of foods you eat are satiating and will keep you full till your next real meal that includes portion control that's why you lose weight not because carbs=evil. The massive weight loss spike at the beginning is because you aren't eating carbs and water weight only sticks when you're eating carbs so no carbs equals no water weight causing you to have that initial 10 to 15 pound weight loss spike. Remember when it comes to any diet or calorie deficit nothing is magic its just calories in calories out and maybe exercise in the mix.,just friendly reminder keto isn't a magic diet,just friendly reminder keto isn't a magic diet The only reason keto works is because you're  limited to filling foods. example if you ate 1000 calories in chips vs 1000 calories in ground beef what will keep you full all day yup the ground beef.

I have been making a smoothie multiple times a week as my first meal of the day for years now. I weight train and do cardio several days a week. I have slowly added in ingredients over time to try and get a decently healthy meal and this is the final product thus far. 

2-3 cups of greens that include spinach, kale, and chard. If I can find all 3 , I put all 3 in. If I can find baby spinach/kale/chard, I put that it . 

1 cup or more of blackberries, blueberries,  raspberries(frozen and/or fresh). I try to go for all three if it's available. 

1 scoop protein powder that is 20g protein, usually plant based, and under 150 calories.

1 teaspoon of Ceylon cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg

1/2 teaspoon of yellow mustard powder

The way my genetics are has allowed me to basically eat whatever I want well into my 30s. While still looking roughly the same as I did in college. 

But I know that won’t last…

I want to gain like 10 lbs of muscle (doesn’t have to be quick). So my daily diet (not the best, but I’m learning…again) so far is:

Breakfast- apple/grapes, huel/Soylent, sausage patties

Lunch- 24 ounces white/chocolate whole milk, kind bar

The way my genetics are has allowed me to basically eat whatever I want well into my 30s. While still looking roughly the same as I did in college. 

But I know that won’t last…

I want to gain like 10 lbs of muscle (doesn’t have to be quick). So my daily diet (not the best, but I’m learning…again) so far is:

Breakfast- apple/grapes, huel/Soylent, sausage patties

Lunch- 24 ounces white/chocolate whole milk, kind bar

Before COVID lockdown, I liked my body, but the way I got to that weight was by denying myself breakfast and lunch (mostly lunch) and starving myself. This was due to my anxiety at school making me feel like others would shame me for eating when I was as large as I initially was. So, I just never ate, or had a tiny tray of fruit that my friends picked off the line so the lunch ladies wouldn’t harp at them. Then lockdown happened, and I was no longer nervous about eating. I quickly gained the weight back, and now I’m full of ugly stretch marks and fat.

I’ve tried nearly every healthy way to lose the weight. Dieting, yoga, exercise, but nothing has worked. I’ve literally made no progress, and the only thing dictating my weight gain and loss are my menstrual periods and other stuff. I hate being so damn round and unattractive, and some of my peers prod at me for gaining the weight back, and how I’m not trying hard enough. I’m tempted to fall back on starving myself, because that clearly worked better than actual healthy ways to lose weight. I was happier then, even if my stomach felt like it was tearing itself apart from hunger. However, I know that it isn’t healthy, and I’m exposing myself to the possibility of eating disorders. At this point, I’m just picking lesser evils.

call me childish or whatever but i am a picky eater for quite a few different varietes of food and its difficult for me, i just started going to the gym and i am trying to start to eat healthier and i am wondering if people have tips to help with this for someone who doesnt eat a lot of vegatables or salad and how to try new foods and cope with trying it or however i can explain it in a way that makes sense. I love fruit and will eat many different fruits but i know vegatables are more important, i really only like cucumbers because they dont have a taste really and potatos if that counts in any form not just unhealthy and deepfried not that potatos are very healthy to begin with. I might like some other vegatables but i cant think of anything else that counts as vegatables right now that i eat so id have to think about it more. So far before ive tried carrots and i find them disgusting and vile i cant eat them without gagging they dont taste that bad i dont think really but my body rejects it. Is there any types of vegatables that dont have much taste or that taste not bitter and maybe somewhat sweet and dont have any smell or not a noticable smell?

Also if anyone knows is it okay to still drink diet pop (soda) sometimes i also am giving up on my slight addiction to diet soda since its not good but is it okay to drink sometimes like not even everyday just once and a while? Same with zero sugar types of foods like no sugar jello is it bad to eat if i am only eating like one a day as a snack because i am diebetic and i eat those for snacks sometimes because of no carbs. The main thing i hear about things with sweetner is that they mess with your matabolism and generally arent good for you still so i am asking for anyone who has an opinion on it if they could help me out with this too.

Another thing is that i am still only 15 years old and growing so i dont want to undereat trying to do a calorie deficit and limit my growth. I went on tdee calculator and searched my maintence calories whilst doing 4 days a week at the gym and daily exercise at home the days i dont go to the gym. It says my maintence is 2,577 calories a day so if i eat about 1800-2000 calories a day with this exercise routine will that make me loose weight while i build muscle in the gym? Along with healthy eating of course.

but here’s the thing. ever since i started repairing my lifestyle (specifically with food) that changed. FAST. and i don’t understand it and i can’t seem to get used to it. so, originally, i had a calorie deficit i wanted to follow, but i found i had to keep increasing it. not because of cravings, not because of being guilty and cheating my diet, but because I am SO UNBELIEVABLY HUNGRY!

I’ve had to have multiple protein bars, 2 eggs, some steak and even nearly half a bag of pistachios (throughout the day) and after every single one of those i was STILL hungry! and that doesn’t even include the rest of the meals today. 

I just don’t know what to do! Should i be eating when i’m hungry or not?!? This totally ruined my plan to start a healthy calorie deficit! I know that having a fast metabolism means you can essentially eat more food without gaining weight because of the calorie oxygen and energy process and whatever, but another part of me feels deep guilt for eating that much, EVEN though I know the stuff i’m eating is healthy. and, a third part of me says this will all backfire and either a. i will physically not be able to lose any weight without being extremely hungry all the time, or B. i’ll end up gaining all of the past few days worth of food in very high numbers under the impression that my fast metabolism will “take care of it.” It doesn’t help that if i “don’t eat” i immediately start getting symptoms of nutrient deficiency i. e. extreme tiredness, immediately and sort of severely lightheaded upon sitting or standing (though i have always been subject to something called POTS,) hard time focusing , headaches, etc. (sounds worse on paper , but really it’s not that severe or affects me too a concerning point)

i know by reading this you are probably all under the influence that i have some kinda crazy eating disorder that i’m sugarcoating, but have faith in me; i don’t ! 

but in conclusion, i’m feeling all sorts of things. anger, mostly, since the control i wanted to have on my body was immediately revoked once again, but also hunger…

tldr: wanting to lose weight, started to eat healthy, exercise, and begin a calorie deficit when suddenly my metabolism decided to be faster than the wild west to the point where i can’t go 5 minutes without eating despite heavy intake on things like protein and fats to keep myself filled; thus ruining the whole point of my calorie deficit. got to a point where I faced some starvation symptoms just from 20-30 minutes withdrawal of food. Not sure where to go from here— continue eating as much food as my body is telling me (which by the way is a HUGE amount of food, legit destroyed the fridge in just a few days and still
hungry) whilst worried that i won’t achieve weight loss, or try to cut back on the food and achieve a calorie deficit despite my extreme appetite.

or maybe just a trip to my doctor.

i know by reading this you are probably all under the influence that i have some kinda crazy eating disorder that i’m sugarcoating, but have faith in me; i don’t ! 

but in conclusion, i’m feeling all sorts of things. anger, mostly, since the control i wanted to have on my body was immediately revoked once again, but also hunger…

tldr: wanting to lose weight, started to eat healthy, exercise, and begin a calorie deficit when suddenly my metabolism decided to be faster than the wild west to the point where i can’t go 5 minutes without eating despite heavy intake on things like protein and fats to keep myself filled; thus ruining the whole point of my calorie deficit. got to a point where I faced some starvation symptoms just from 20-30 minutes withdrawal of food. Not sure where to go from here— continue eating as much food as my body is telling me (which by the way is a HUGE amount of food, legit destroyed the fridge in just a few days and still
hungry) whilst worried that i won’t achieve weight loss, or try to cut back on the food and achieve a calorie deficit despite my extreme appetite.

or maybe just a trip to my doctor.

additional info: 5'3, 150 lbs, f, no family history of diabetes, history of fainting, previous binge eat problems."

0,"I (21f) have had an anaphylactic allergy to peanuts and tree nuts all my life. My partner (22m) and I started dating a few months ago and recently he’s apparently tried to cut nuts out of his diet for my sake. However, he started experiencing some pretty sharp stomach pain and we realized it’s because he didn’t make up for the nutrients he lost after he stopped eating nuts. Since then I told him to just go back to his usual diet and then not eat nuts if we’re going to see each other, but I know he does eventually want to try to eliminate nuts for the most part.

My partner (22m) and I started dating a few months ago and recently he’s apparently tried to cut nuts out of his diet for my sake. However, he started experiencing some pretty sharp stomach pain and we realized it’s because he didn’t make up for the nutrients he lost after he stopped eating nuts. Since then I told him to just go back to his usual diet and then not eat nuts if we’re going to see each other, but I know he does eventually want to try to eliminate nuts for the most part.

0,"*Hi thank you all in advance. I'm after some advice. I have been going to the gym got 15+ years constantly switching between lifting weights doing cardio HiIT classes or both. In march I got COVID and was sick at the sight of myself despite all my hard work I was still podgy and at 5ft 8 and 80kgs I looked like crap. I enlisted a personal trainer and after 3 months I managed to get down to 76kgs and around 18 to 19% body fat. I did this on:
Daily:
2206kcal a day
190g protein
154g carbs*
91g fat
1 cheat meal a week.

This worked for about 2 months and now I've hir a plateau for the last 4, constantly bouncing between 76 and 78kgs and 18 to 20% body fat with no improvement.

I have looked to reduce my macros again to sub 2000kcal maybe 1800 to 1900.

A lot of diets say cut out carbs and just fats but how tf do I eat that many calories with no carbs and just protein??? 190g a day is already way too much for my weight and height. I've seen one diet suggesting 254g protein a day? Thats well over 2 per kg in body weight and surely dangerous?

I've also seen people say just lift heaver hut I'm naturally very weak for a guy. My 1rpm after 3 months of deadlifting with a personal trainer is still only 120-125 and bench around 80kg 1rpm.

I do 5 on 2 off at the gym 3 days lifting and cardio  the other 2 cardio or lifting. The weight lifting is a 4 days split of chest, back, legs and shoulders (main lifts being bench, deadlift, squat and military) 

I just want to shred that little bit more but I can't work out my macros with low carbs and less calories while keeping within safe amounts of food and not too much protein.

0,"Hello I have a question about healthily losing weight!

This Monday I started with a diet to get more into shape. Let me start with the context. I'm 28 years old, 1.65cm and weighed 76 kg on Sunday which I took as my starting point. I don't wanna lose a lot but I really want to get back under the 70 kg maybe a little more.
I did a few of those online tests to check how many calories I should consume to lose weight and they all averaged around 1850 kcal per day split into 3 to 4 meals a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack somewhere in between).

Since then I've been tracking my meals quite precisely. I decided to just weigh myself everyday to check when things would start kicking in but noticed the following. I weight myself in the morning before breakfast.

Sunday: 76
Monday: 75.1
Tuesday: 74.7
Wednesday: 74.5
Thursday: 73.9

This shocked me a bit? Losing 2 kilos in 4 days does not sound entirely healthy? But I'm not overly sure!
I have never been on a diet before. I do notice that what I eat now is Way less then how I used to eat before I started. I've also added more regular exercise to my daily schedule.

If anyone has some insight I'd love to hear it!

0,"Two questions in one! I was researching for a while and learned about brown rice. I got some from dollar tree once (bad idea) and didn't taste that great. Recently was researching and found the healthiest brown rice according to google, Lundberg Family Farms long grain brown rice.

Not sure if that's true or not. 😅 Since doing more research about rice I see articles and health sites saying that it contains arsenic. Some I saw said it had very low levels and you could wash it to get rid of it. Honestly just seeing all of that made me not want to consume rice at all anymore. I'm not sure what to believe.

The other question was what can I do to incorporate veggies in my diet? 

I made a post before about veggies and fruit, and how I was originally going to make smoothies whenever I could make the money to buy the blender I wanted.

Then I saw peeps saying blending isn't such a great idea, for some reasons. One being about fruit turning into ""free sugars"" or something, like refined sugars you see in desserts and all that. Idk bruh. 

The reason why I had that idea was because I was weaned on really processed and bad food since I was a kid. So I'm like... literally incapable of enjoying fresh real healthy veggies and fruit.

I hate the pulp. I hate the texture. Just yesterday I attempted to consume a Navel Orange, since I researched about them yesterday and mistook them for being regular oranges. They're apparently sweeter.

Attempted to bite into it and...I couldn't even get the flesh off 😂 but I tasted the juice and it was nice! Not super sweet like desserts which I'm pretty sure is how it's supposed to be, but not tangy or sour like a regular orange. All I got everytime I bit into it was the juice not the pulp anyway. Still, progress. I guess?


I'm not really sure how to incorporate any of that into my diet...if I can somehow incorporate some veggies into my diet that I actually ENJOY and if I leave fruits for smoothies, would that be good enough? Idk what to do here.

I do use fruits in brines and a bunch of herbs like oregano, thyme, basil, all that great stuff. I love dried herbs! So it's not like I don't get any sort of greens but obviously, that is not enough. 😅 The only thing I bought recently is some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to put into my chicken taco meat whenever I make that. Again, doesn't really feel like enough..or if that's even healthy compared to fresh peppers.

&amp;#x200B;

first post here. I am asking for advice for my girlfriend actually. She is 28 and has gained weight in the last 10 years or so to the point she is around 40lbs heavier than she should. She has never been much active but when a young girl used to bike and walk a lot and has gained a lot of muscle, compared to the overall weight, for her age. She has quite large legs but weak arms. To correct all this, she has been followed by a dietician in the last 2 years but with meager results.

At the beginning of this year she asked the dietician for a plan that would allow here to lose at least half the amount she has before our summer vacation in September. The dietician was positive this was perfectly doable and prepared a diet of about 1750kcal for a TDEE of 1680kcal. She gave her some light exercising to do 3 days a week.

The issue is, due to covid and other health issues, neither me nor her have been exercising regularly in the past 3-4 months. Some weeks we do as planned, other weeks we completely skip. We don't go to the gym but train at home. My gf has stomach issues that we need to investigate about that cause her to switch some dishes every other day because otherwise the acidity is unbearable. She is going to get tested this month about this.

So, despite not following religiously the diet nor exercising much, she has lost about 3.5lbs of fat while gaining 4.5lbs of muscle since February.  She is at the same point as she was, more or less, months ago but with less fat and more muscle.

The dietician doesn't understand how she could have gained muscle while eating barely the TDEE and being incostant with exercising. She suspects myostatin-induced muscle hypertrophy. We don't know yet for certain though.

My question is: if it were true, what could my gf do to steadily lose fat? She doesn't care about muscles nor want to join a gym and is actually scared more regular exercising would only make her bulk more rather than slimming down. Anybody has any suggestion or a similar case?

first post here. I am asking for advice for my girlfriend actually. She is 28 and has gained weight in the last 10 years or so to the point she is around 40lbs heavier than she should. She has never been much active but when a young girl used to bike and walk a lot and has gained a lot of muscle, compared to the overall weight, for her age. She has quite large legs but weak arms.

So i've been dealing with headaches for the last few weeks, like non-stop really bad ones and i got one going right now. pretty concerned and generally uncomfortable. for reasons i'd rather not go into I can't see a doctor, So i'm kinda stuck figuring this out myself, but it's probably fine or something

A few months ago I had a blood test and i came up pretty short on potassium (within 15% iirc). So I was looking at what i've been eating and I realized there's barely any potassium, like the only thing with noticeable potassium i typically eat is milk, and maybe this is a coincidence but the headaches started when I stopped drinking milk. (Prior to this i'd drink like 4 cups a day or something)

iirc the headaches started about 3 days after I stopped drinking that much milk actually

Aside from the headaches I i think i've also been having digestion issues? like june was the first time i've ever had trouble digesting a burger patty, or something like that anyway. I was down for a day or two because of it. Had a patty just recently and it went down fine tho even with the headaches still going so i'm really not sure

but am I totally on the wrong track with my potassium theory? i dont think anyone meets the daily potassium requirements so i find it hard to believe no one else would be having these same problems if it ere a potassium thing. But even if my theory's accurate, should i just eat potassium-rich foods and hope something changes?

Is it okay to eat chips or a candy bar for desert everyday. 

I have noticed that the more i restrict myself the more i want to have those foods. But if i « give in » to my desires i would eat ice cream after every meal. I don’t know if that is considered « okay ». Really having a hard here. I thought of counting calories but i find it a bit stressful. I would love to have some advice reddit"

0," I've been losing weight the past 6 weeks focusing on more protein and less sugars and reached my goal of 65kg. Im an athlete height 171cm age 23 and just an estimation but im at around 6-7% fat.  
As a long distance runner (not professional but serious training 7 days/week ) my weight is still 5-10 kg higher than my co athletes (about same height) in the team but I'm more muscular so maintaining 65 kg is my first goal.

I started about 6 weeks ago at 69kg and from online calculators I found that i need about 1900 calories (without the ones burnt from exercise) to maintain my weight and at 75% (\~1400 cal) to lose 0.5kg per week. Every time I reach 65kg though (over the years and then jumped back at 69kg) I start feeling hungry all the time and cant seem to do the same thing i've been doing the past weeks. My calorie intake is 1400 calories + 500-600 cal depending on the intensity of the workout. My goal this time is to maintain the 65kg and in about a month or so start to aim lower/at a slower rate since ill have adjusted.

Do I just start eating 1900 calories + whatever i burn instead of 1400 or will doing this result in gaining even though its what i should be taking due to the long period of dieting? Do I feel hungry all the time because my fat% is super low now or does it mean that I am doing something wrong with my diet.

The current calorie breakdown is 400cal breakfast (6-8am) 200cal at 10am 500cal launch at 12am 300cal at 4pm and the extra 500-600cal after training at 9-10 pm.",Maintain weight after diet,"Maintain weight after diet  I've been losing weight the past 6 weeks focusing on more protein and less sugars and reached my goal of 65kg.

Every time I reach 65kg though (over the years and then jumped back at 69kg) I start feeling hungry all the time and cant seem to do the same thing i've been doing the past weeks. My calorie intake is 1400 calories + 500-600 cal depending on the intensity of the workout. My goal this time is to maintain the 65kg and in about a month or so start to aim lower/at a slower rate since ill have adjusted.

Do I just start eating 1900 calories + whatever i burn instead of 1400 or will doing this result in gaining even though its what i should be taking due to the long period of dieting? Do I feel hungry all the time because my fat% is super low now or does it mean that I am doing something wrong with my diet.

The current calorie breakdown is 400cal breakfast (6-8am) 200cal at 10am 500cal launch at 12am 300cal at 4pm and the extra 500-600cal after training at 9-10 pm."

0,"Most of my life I've spent it going up and down in weight, I'd hit a goal weight, then think the job's done and eat my way back up to the triple digit figures. I finally found that counting calories was what worked best for me to reach and maintain my weight goals.

Now I've been cutting for close to 5 months with no weight training, went from 103KGS to 91KGs with a 500 calorie deficit from my 2500 maintenance, then started lifting and continued cutting for another 5 months (10 total) and went from 91KGs to 83KGs while maintaining the same amount of deficit from my first 5 months cutting (2000 calories a day was still working).

Ever since I hit 83KGs it started getting tough to lose more weight so I turned my intake down to 1750, I'm losing 0.3-0.5KGs per week. My issue with this is that I'm not feeling the greatest in terms of sleep, hunger, and strength in the gym but I don't mind powering through it as it's not impossible and I still haven't hit an amount of body fat I'm happy with when I look in the mirror.

I don't think I'm at a detrimentally low amount of calorie intake for me to stop the cut, but it does affect the mental a little bit (nothing I can't power through though). But maybe I should reverse diet and see if it would benefit me more? (183cm Male)

Thanks!!",Should I reverse diet or stick to my cut?,"Should I reverse diet or stick to my cut? Most of my life I've spent it going up and down in weight, I'd hit a goal weight, then think the job's done and eat my way back up to the triple digit figures. I finally found that counting calories was what worked best for me to reach and maintain my weight goals.

Now I've been cutting for close to 5 months with no weight training, went from 103KGS to 91KGs with a 500 calorie deficit from my 2500 maintenance, then started lifting and continued cutting for another 5 months (10 total) and went from 91KGs to 83KGs while maintaining the same amount of deficit from my first 5 months cutting (2000 calories a day was still working).

Ever since I hit 83KGs it started getting tough to lose more weight so I turned my intake down to 1750, I'm losing 0.3-0.5KGs per week. My issue with this is that I'm not feeling the greatest in terms of sleep, hunger, and strength in the gym but I don't mind powering through it as it's not impossible and I still haven't hit an amount of body fat I'm happy with when I look in the mirror.

0,"I'm 20, 5'10"", and currently about 78kg/170lb at 18% body fat. My goal is to reach 10% body fat before returning to a gradual clean bulk.

Normally I eat at maintenance of around 2700 calories, however, I'm currently working a manual labour job 9-10 hours a day, 5 days a week, burning in the ballpark of 3500 to 4000 extra calories per day (job is pretty full on), while still doing my 5 weight training sessions per week.

I'm planning to reach my goal by reducing my calorie intake to about 2500 calories, and bumping up my protein to around 180g per day. This would give me a weekly deficit of around 20k calories until I reach my goal body fat.

I would love to hear your opinions and thoughts on whether this is a good, okay, bad, or god awful idea. I've been sticking to 2500 calories for the last 3 days of working so I don't expect my commitment to be a limiting factor, but ideally I would like to reduce muscle mass loss if you think I wouldn't be able to put it back on easily when returning to maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm debating if I should go back to eating poultry, specifically chicken and turkey.. I was vegetarian for five years and went back to eating fish couple years ago (so, 5 years vegetarian, 2 years pescatarian). I decided to go back to eating fish to help meet my daily protein intake without supplementing.. Could I have been vegetarian and eat all my daily protein? Yes, but it was so difficult. Plus, from a social perspective it was also soooo hard for people to accommodate my diet, they never knew what i could eat and sometimes was so embarrassing.. so fish was easier, plus i personally didn't have any ethical reasons to not eat fish.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm back to eating fish, I feel like my options are so little still lol.. I live in southern Ontario and my fresh fish options are like.. salmon, trout and tilapia basically. I can eat cod, haddock, shrimp, etc, but they're mostly frozen and smelly. Back when i lived in Brazil, good fish was fresh and straight out of ocean. Now my daily diet is mostly some fish + beyond meat, beyond sausage, impossible burger etc... And these processed meats have so much fat, calories and salt I don't even know if it's healthy. Can I eat more beans? Probably, but who eats fish and beans..? Not appetizing at all.. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm debating going back to eating poultry and I wanted to know if anyone went through what I'm going through. Any advice, tips.. Also thinking about ethical reasons?

I am currently 81 kilos and 179cm height - my lately Boditrax scan showed a 25.3 BMI, 16.9% fat (13.7kg) and 79% muscle (64kg).  


I want to drop my fat percentage mainly while staying toned because i have annoying spot fat around the love handles and chest.  


My problem has always been consistency, as i could go into a good routine of working out at the gym 3-4times a week while on a calorific deficit for 2 months, but then take a break and start all over again.  


As you know, after 33 years old i have found it a lot harder to lose weight and slim down, but after being introduced to intermittent fasting i am back on a good roll with diet and exercise.  


At the moment, if i am not going out i follow the below:  


\- Intermittent fasting 16:8 (22:00 to 14:00)  
\- Break fast with protein meal replacement and porridge  
\- Work out (3-4 times a week approx 90mins out of which 30mins cardio)  
\- Whey protein shake  
\- A good balanced meal  


I have dropped around 4 kilos in a month in this way and can lift more at the gym/getting stronger.  


**My question is regarding the overall calorific intake.**  


I have quite a low calorific average on MyFitnessPal, as i have my food target to 1650 and then i work out on top so it drops a lot.  
The current weekly average is around **1100** to **1200** after removing the calories from the workouts ( i track them with chest heart monitor).  


Thing is that my hunger is very manageable and when i am fasting i just have 2 cups of black coffee and a hydralyte supplement (sodium, magnesium and vitamin C) so i dont really feel i consume so little calories.  


Is this plan healthy ? Should i keep it like that for the time being at least ? What do you think?

Fast forward and i started monitoring my calorie intake because i don't feel good (headaches and stuff), only to find out I'm struggling to reach 1500 calories a day (or 1000 some days for that matter). Afaik a guy my size needs like 2000+ calories daily, but I'm just not hungry and i can't being myself to. In this moment i'm almost afraid of eating. right now it seems like previously i'd only been maintaining my calorie intake by eating excessive amounts of junk food, which is kind of unsettling.

0," Shilajit is a blackish-brown sticky substance, that is formed by the slow decomposition of plants and minerals on the rocks of the Himalayas.  People have been using Shilajit for centuries to cure various problems from Alzheimer’s to impotence in men. 

 There are many shilajit benefits for men including increasing Male fertility and testosterone.

Testosterone is the primary sex hormone in males but some men experience low testosterone levels due to various circumstances. The symptoms of low testosterone levels include-

* A low sex drive
* Loss of hair
* Loss of muscle mass
* Fatigue
* Increased body fat

A study published in the journal Andrologia studied the effect of shilajit in 35 infertile males. During the test 100mg of shilajit in capsule form was provided to them regularly for 90 days.

The results were surprising as 28 out of 30 men showed significant increases in total sperm count, sperm motility, and the amount of healthy sperm, a measure of how well the sperm move.

Thus eating shilajit regularly may benefit men with high testosterone levels and an increase in sperm count.

0,"Hello All,

I am currently trying to get into shape (working out, eating a healthier diet, etc), but there are always some days where I get a sudden craving for junk food (so far I've been pretty successful at fending off these cravings). However, this made me wonder if there has been any scientific proof on whether it is ""healthier"" to binge junk food all at once, or spread out over the course of a week (assuming you still eat as normal every day, the junk food would just be surplus Calories). (ex. Eating 7 cookies in a day VS eating 1 cookie a day over a week).

My own hypothesis is that binging it all at once would be ""healthier"" since the human stomach does not have 100% efficiency in absorbing nutrients. So if you overload the intestines in one go, you would cumulatively absorb less than if you ate it over a week, giving the intestines a better chance at absorbing more nutrients.

I would love to know if anyone has read peer-reviewed papers on this subject (please see to article if available), or even personal anecdotal evidence.

If there's truth to any of this, how long will it take for the effects to kick in? Because it doesn't taste too good.

Is there any scientific research or statistics factually backing any of this?

Thanks for any help."

0,"Looking for some advice around ongoing joint and muscle pain that feels like inflammation, and it's possible causes

Some background info. I'm a 29 year old male. I live an active and generally healthy lifestyle. My occupation is physical at times. I lift weights several times a week, ride my bike, walk regularly, as well as other sports from time to time. I stretch and foam roll often. I have quit smoking and cut down drinking significantly in the past year. I'm 180cm and 84kg (5foot11 and 182 pounds)

Basically in the last year or 2 my body had not felt quite right. I have constant niggles in my joints. Lifting weights feels harder than it should be and at times is painful. I have decreased in strength despite my overall diet and exercise improving in the last few years. I see people at work who are smaller than me lifting moving heavier things with ease while my body aches as I do it. Basically my body mechanics feel off for someone of my size and lifestyle.

I'm starting to think it's inflammation, as I have noticed that anti inflammatories help me feel better overall, and I've had to stop myself from taking them too regularly. I also notice my sinuses generally feel constricted even if they're not blocked and the anti inflammatories help this too

Wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar and has any advice before I start seeing specialists etc.

Open to trying different diets to see if there's something that's causing it, because I'm desperate to get back to my strong and functional self

In order to maintain my weight while cycling 100+ miles a week, I need about 3000-3500 calories a day. My partner is working towards similar miles but with a slower metabolism and a higher starting weight. 

The obvious answer is to cut back severely on what they eat while adjusting the types of food.

The problem is that it seems like it would be complicated for me to join her and still eat enough calories. Of course, I can eat what they eat but more. But I'm admittedly picky and while I'm improving in that respect, if it's something I don't like, I will not get enough calories.

How do we make this work? I want to support them but they cannot eat high-carb foods and it is virtually impossible for me to get enough calories through traditional diets.

0,"Advice on getting back on track

Hi friends I lost 30lbs in 2021 by doing cico and drinking a crap ton of water. I picked up running and working out again and was able to end 2021 30lbs down and a new outlook. December came and I wanted to enjoy the holidays and then I hurt my knee. 

Here we are, June 2022 and I have gained back about 5lbs so I’m mostly maintaining at this point. I need help with avoiding some old bad habits and I will tell you what I am doing so maybe y’all can help with some new things to try!

Stats:

- female / 28 /  5’4”, sw: 200lbs cw:175-178 gw: 155lbs

Good habits:

- I still count calories, between 1500-1700 a day as a goal because I workout 5-6 times a week

- I don’t drink my calories. Coffee, water, nut milks is all I drink. 

- no alcohol 

- started therapy to help myself understand my poor relationship with food and binge eating

- I try to make meals ahead - not the best meal prepper but I do portion meals out to have something a head of time 

- I drink so much water! 120-150oz a day

- I have done my rear on cico, IF, Paleo and keto diets. I love them all and I practice a little of each to keep myself sane and also feeding my body well. 

Areas of opportunity:

- lack consistency, I fall off the wagon more than I would like

- binge snacking/eating habits 

- food triggers my brain in a way I can explain, it’s almost like I am chemically/physically addicted 


I really need help picking up some good healthy habits I can try, to attempt to stay on track and continue bettering my weight, health, relationship with food. I have the will to change, I am a single mom just trying to be the best me for my 5 year old daughter. I don’t want her to struggle like I do with food. Any input or advice is appropriated!

Please share all your tricks and tips that helped you stay healthy, balanced, on target for your goals!

A few days ago I've started carefully counting calories and I've realized that I've been overestimating my calorie intake out of disbelief that it could really be that little. I mean, I would say my daily diet has been around 2.300 daily kcal, which I guess would be a normal manteinance caloric intake for an active 20yr old average height man, but for me it makes it just over the BMR.

For some years I've been around 25% body fat and slightly overweight, and haven't been able to get it down by any means, consistently losing 3-4 kg to regain them in a week in which my only ""sins"" were eating more sugar than usual through cakes or soda at a party or whatever.

So these days I've been wondering if my body is in some type of ""starvation mode"", since I've been feeling really tired and lacking of energy for the past 3-4 years, around the time I've been starting to be much taller than the rest.

It's been three months since I've been going to the gym. Five weeks in with my last routine. It's a three days a week routine divided in chest-triceps, shoulders-legs/glutes, back-biceps; it has excercises like deadlifts, hip thrusts and back squats, military press, curls with dumbells and barbell, french press, flat bench press and so on.. 

I eat normally 5 main meals a day: 

*breakfast always with cereals and milk+coffe,

*morning snack (often an apple with some nuts, like walnuts or almonds)

*launch (always pasta/rice with vegetables or legumes like lentils, peas and chickpeas), 

*afternoon snack always with fruit (bananas, oranges in winter and peaches in summer) and a protein bar or some other kind of sweet bar,

*dinner often with meat, chicken, but sometimes also with something made out of vegetables (fish maybe one/two times a month)

I don't follow a diet, count my calories (and I don't really want to fixate on such a thing) or eat things like creatine, protein powders and such. Since I'm going to the gym, I'd like to grow more and get bigger and stronger.

I've been on the carnivore diet for the past 2 weeks (with a return to carbs after first 5 days to get rid of the constant migraines I experienced), been going great aside of having to re-introduce some carbs and have a step by step transition. 

However, like last time I tried a ketogenic diet (1+ year ago) I got some real bad rash that's is driving me nuts (can't get uninterrupted sleep and having to take showers multiple times a day to get the itching down and skin lotion). 

So I've been thinking, I had no idea if this is a good idea or not, but would it be possible to loose weight (mostly from bad food habits in the past) if you'd rotate between a diet like the carnivore and carbs (I know it's kinda cancel out each other). 

**My bad habits looked like the past 20-25 years:**

Lot of pasta, lot of processed food, last 15 years lot of take away. Sedative work past 12 years, office type work, worked in warehouses before so lot of walking/running around.

**My current habits in terms of moving my ass:**

-Going to the gym 3-4 times a week for weight training

-at minimum taking one, 30-40 minute walk 

-At least walking 10,000 steps but usually ends up being 13-16,000.","Rotate Carnivore with carb diets, bad idea?","Rotate Carnivore with carb diets, bad idea? No idea if this is the place to ask.

I started eating protein (ground turkey, salmon, and chicken breast), vegetables (zucchini,yellow squash, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower), banana and orange,  everyday I eat these things. and two of these: almonds and peanuts, greek yogurt, boiled egg, and cottage cheese. Iced coffee (made at home) is my treat also everyday. I do not portion yet as I'm easing into this. Drinking lots of water and going on walks. Will start some strength exercises soon.

In 2 weeks I've lost 12lbs. My fitbit says I'm losing 3k to 4k calories a day. On quick glance it looks like sodium, carbs, cholesterol, sugar, I'm on the low side. I think I'm taking in 1200 to 1600 calories a day. My doctors appointment is still a month away as they were booked out so no blood work yet. 

I have been taking meta mucil. My poops haven't been regular though and I seem to need more fiber. I thought this would get better with a diet. Any ideas how to have a better time in the bathroom? 

How am I doing? Anything I should look into?",diet and bathroom,"diet and bathroom I have no idea what I'm doing diet wise. Just know that I've gained 100lbs due to overeating. 

I started eating protein (ground turkey, salmon, and chicken breast), vegetables (zucchini,yellow squash, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower), banana and orange,  everyday I eat these things. and two of these: almonds and peanuts, greek yogurt, boiled egg, and cottage cheese. Iced coffee (made at home) is my treat also everyday. I do not portion yet as I'm easing into this. Drinking lots of water and going on walks. Will start some strength exercises soon.

I’ve been wanting to loose weight for a while now, and last week i finally decided to go for it.

I’ve always been heavy, not big (always heard that i don’t look my weight) and have lost (and gained) weight in the past.

I’m watching my calories and exercising every other day, (biking 40 minutes in the gym, with a little weight exercise) but i’m scared my calorie intake is too low and that my body will go into starvation mode. Which basically which means i’ll make my goals but will quickly fall back because my body is storing every bit of food.

I’m eating between 1600 and 2400 calories a day, and i burn around 500 calories every other day with exercising. I don’t particularly eat more when I exercise, it depends on my appetite.

I’m getting my calories from yogurt, muesli, oatmeal, bread, proteinpowder and whatever meal is served to me at dinner (still live at home, also i portion the food).

So, from what I read on internet, no: Milk, eggs unless in something and very well cooked, jogurts, cheese, chocolate, citruses, strawberries, hams and most meat.

PM: Dinner is around 6.30pm but I tend to sneak in some other bits and pieces. Crisps, chocolate, fruit and sometimes some bacon and eggs but dinners are mainly meat and veg but can differ.

        I was ultimately wondering about methods for dieting and eating healthy foods(low fat, no cholesterol, no added sugars, etc).
It seems like the only way to do that and eat a manageable amount is to eat at an overall calorie deficit. Any and all health foods seem to be rather low in calories for the amount you’re eating.

0,"In march I began keto at age 33 after eating like a pig all day everyday. I emotionally ate. I habitually ate. My vice was soda and I drank enough soda from age 10 to age 33 to fill up the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The reason I began keto was I was told that I was prediabetic and needed to get my blood sugar under control. So I started at 310 and am currently 264. But I made some serious mistakes.

My huge mistake was I thought ONLY sugar was spiking insulin. I figured that as long as I ate meats and cheeses and drank sugar free diet sodas that it wouldn't effect me. The aspartame made me drink even more soda and snack more than before and I thought I was okay because again ""it wasn't sugar"".

Mistake 2 was I did not start intermediate fasting until Saturday or 8 weeks in to keto. The reason was I was doing meal prep late Friday and early Saturday morning. I was hungry for a snack so I cooked 2 sirloin steaks for a late dinner at like 1am. And I had this big pack of medium pork chops I got at Target that was sitting in my fridge a couple days. I fried them in the steak juices and they looked so good I decided to have a couple pork chops for desert. After all its not sugar!

What I found out was on Saturday I felt like garbage. The worse I have felt since I had the sugar withdrawals when I began keto. I was tired and I kept trying to jumpstart myself with caffeine and it didn't work. Then I got in touch with my friend the nutritionist who told me all the signs I exhibit are that of insulin resistant. On my break I watched Dr Berg videos and I discovered that its not just sugar that makes your insulin spike. Its stuff like protein and caffeine! I had no idea. The past 2 months I have had more meat then probably at anytime in my life. Because I was trying to fill up and be satisfied so I wouldn't resist the temptation to run to McDonalds and bing eat 50 burgers or something. And I used the caffeine (and the aspartame) as a replacement to defeat the sugar addiction/cravings.

So I fasted on Saturday night from 8pm into 12pm the next day. Then I had 2 meals Sunday and after binge watching more Dr Berg I decided to get serious. I intermediate fasted from 7:10PM Sunday to 5:45 today. I almost made it the 48 hours but I caved when I started feeling cramps and started getting cranky. 46 1/2 hours was a good start I figured.

I ate 2 roasted chicken thighs and 16oz of some homeade chilli (italian sausage, ground beef, no sugar, yellow, red and green bell peppers, no beer, deglased with a little red wine, no beans, onions, garlic and onions and salt and pepper). I felt bloated afterwards and decided not to eat the salad I brought. I have decided to not eat until tommorow. Going to regularly do the 16:8 fast. Do a big one monthly. I am getting my blood tested again in June and did schedule an apointment with a cardiologist to check my heart after years of crap eating.

Dr Berg has not mentioned any foods that dont spike insulin in his videos (that Ive seen) are there any?",What are some foods you can eat on keto that DONT spike insulin?,"What are some foods you can eat on keto that DONT spike insulin?

0,"Hey guys. I'm unfamilar with the health and diet side of Reddit, so let me know if there's a better place to post this instead. 

I'm currently 21 years old and started going vegan at 14. When I made the decision, it was mostly because of my compassion for animals and my concern for the environment, with any health benefit being a plus. Now that I'm older, I have a much more nuanced way of looking at things, and I pay a lot more attention to my health and wellbeing. Lately I've been concerned with the fact that I've been on such a restrictive diet for so long, especially during such an important developmental time. I struggle with mental health issues and I experience negative physical symptoms daily, such as dizziness, nausea, and headaches. Though I can't determine the exact cause of these symptoms, I figure that making sure my diet is well balanced and my health is taken care of is a good foundation for managing them. This has lead me to wanting a more dependable source of B12, aminos, omegas etc. in my diet. I currently take supplements, but I still find myself craving a more well balanced diet.

Though I no longer am morally opposed to the consumption of animals, I still am very uncomfortable with animal agriculture, especially due to its unsustainability. I have done a lot of research on non-vegan foods, and have come up with two options that are satisfactory to me in terms of ethics and sustainability: bivalves and insects. Bivalves do not have a brain or a nervous system capable of feeling pain. The farming of oysters in particular can actually be beneficial to the environment, because they filter the water. Insects were something that randomly occured to me, and so I started researching. Apparently over 2 billion people consume insects every day. They are a good source of protein, omegas, and B12, and are filling but low in calories. The farming of insects is sustainable and is done in a way which I would assume would be painless, which is slowly freezing them until they are unconcious. Some commonly consumed insects include crickets, silkworms, grasshoppers, cockroaches, and mealworms. I found something called cricket flour, which is what you think it is. I am interested in trying this product in particular.

My proposed diet would be my current diet, but with oysters and cricket flour added in on certain days, just enough to keep that balance. I still do want to keep my diet mostly plant-based. This is my current diet:
Breakfast - whole wheat toast with vegetable oil ""butter""
Lunch - Soy-based patty on bun, with a carb (rice or pasta), lentils or chickpeas, vegetables (carrots, kale/spinach, or broccoli), lots of fruit, nuts (almonds, peanuts, sunflower seeds), nutritional yeast, and a glass of orange juice.
Dinner - varies but usually a stew or chili with beans, lentils, potato, tomato, sometimes vegan soy or pea based beef immitation.
Supplements- multi, cal-mag plus, probiotic, flaxseed oil, and B-complex, iron and D2 on alternating days.
I would eat maybe an oyster a couple days a week at dinnertime. I would sprinkle cricket flour in oatmeal and in smoothies to have throughout the day.

My questions: What do you think about this diet? Have any of you tried being vegan? Have you ever considered insects as a healthy food source? Would you ever try them? Do you have any other ideas about healthy, sustainable and ethical non-vegan foods? Do you have any other tips or ideas for me, or any thoughts in general?

Eating this much creates a deficit of 1200 calories on average and goes as high as 1700-1800. And I am reading in that this is too much of a deficit and it is unhealthy.

0,"I'm 21 (M), 183cm (height, 52kg (weight). I've been  ±52kg for the past 7 years. My BMI ([https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/)) is 15.5

I  never went to the doctor to get a proper diagnosis or opened up to  professionals about my problem. For the majority of life, I thought that  my body and eating ""habits"" (not really habits because my diet never  depended on me) were normal. As I grew older, I looked at my past and  realized that I've been underfed and ""starved"" for my whole bringing up.

I'm  not asking for anyone to give me a diagnosis, though I would appreciate  if anyone can suggest one. I have a hard time eating food, mostly  chewing and swallowing (probably caused by my way of eating). I cannot  eat large quantities of food, and generally don't have the biggest  appetite. Although I want to (mentally) eat normally and gain weight, my  body is not used to it due to over 2 decades of abuse (not eating  enough, horrible diet). When I eat, I aim to eat as fast as possible and  to swallow as quickly as I can — eating isn't necessarily an activity I  enjoy. Basically, when I eat, I aim to get food from A to B as fast as  possible. It's not as though I swallow whole foods or anything like  that, it's just that I physically and mentally don't enjoy the process  of eating — whether that's because of the food that I'm eating or not, I  cannot confirm.

To give a short  backstory, my parents never properly fed me, my mother to this day makes  1 meal a day, sometimes not even that. My diet currently consists of  eating small things, maybe 2-4 sandwitches a day (4 is mostly when  mother doesn't prepare a meal a day). The food that I eat isn't  nutritious, it's mostly snacks, things to kill the sensation of hunger.

From  my understanding, anorexia usually includes people purposefully not  eating enough, but in my case it's an outside factor (my parents) that  is causing me to eat poorly.

I  have the will to gain weight, but because there is a lack of food in my  household, I am unable to do that in a healthy way. The only food  resource that I have a lot of are eggs. Currently I have a lot of  chicken and turkey eggs.

TL;DR —  Am underweight because of bad eating habits caused by parents and the  lack of food in the house. I do not enjoy or strive to stay underweight,  but lack of food and my body are preventing me from changing my  ""condition""

So, recently I tried  to bring something nutritious in my ""diet"". I cannot stand boiled or  cooked eggs (taste), so I decided to make a ""protein"" shake that  consists of: 1 banana, 3 raw turkey eggs, a little bit of milk,  sometimes a little bit of sugar. I would mash the banana, stir (idk if  this is the correct term) raw eggs in a bowl, put the two together in a  bottle, add some milk, and then mix this and drink it all at once. I  made two of these milkshakes a day, but my body couldn't handle it.

After three days, I had bad stomach aches/cramps and was constipated. I had a mild diarrhea.

Is  there anything I  can do to stop my body's reaction? I wish I could  have something else in my diet as of now, but eggs are my only hope and  the only thing that I know I have a lot of. Down the line I would like  to add some oatmeal to my diet. I know that I should seek professional  help from nutritionists and professionals, but I cannot afford such  help.",Body not reacting well to a new diet (trying to gain weight after being underweight/anorexic my whole life) [HELP],"Body not reacting well to a new diet (trying to gain weight after being underweight/anorexic my whole life) [HELP] I'm 21 (M), 183cm (height, 52kg (weight). I've been  ±52kg for the past 7 years. My BMI ([https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/)) is 15.5

I  never went to the doctor to get a proper diagnosis or opened up to  professionals about my problem. For the majority of life, I thought that  my body and eating ""habits"" (not really habits because my diet never  depended on me) were normal. As I grew older, I looked at my past and  realized that I've been underfed and ""starved"" for my whole bringing up.

I'm  not asking for anyone to give me a diagnosis, though I would appreciate  if anyone can suggest one. I have a hard time eating food, mostly  chewing and swallowing (probably caused by my way of eating). I cannot  eat large quantities of food, and generally don't have the biggest  appetite. Although I want to (mentally) eat normally and gain weight, my  body is not used to it due to over 2 decades of abuse (not eating  enough, horrible diet). When I eat, I aim to eat as fast as possible and  to swallow as quickly as I can — eating isn't necessarily an activity I  enjoy. Basically, when I eat, I aim to get food from A to B as fast as  possible. It's not as though I swallow whole foods or anything like  that, it's just that I physically and mentally don't enjoy the process  of eating — whether that's because of the food that I'm eating or not, I  cannot confirm.

To give a short  backstory, my parents never properly fed me, my mother to this day makes  1 meal a day, sometimes not even that. My diet currently consists of  eating small things, maybe 2-4 sandwitches a day (4 is mostly when  mother doesn't prepare a meal a day). The food that I eat isn't  nutritious, it's mostly snacks, things to kill the sensation of hunger.

From  my understanding, anorexia usually includes people purposefully not  eating enough, but in my case it's an outside factor (my parents) that  is causing me to eat poorly.

I  have the will to gain weight, but because there is a lack of food in my  household, I am unable to do that in a healthy way. The only food  resource that I have a lot of are eggs. Currently I have a lot of  chicken and turkey eggs.

TL;DR —  Am underweight because of bad eating habits caused by parents and the  lack of food in the house. I do not enjoy or strive to stay underweight,  but lack of food and my body are preventing me from changing my  ""condition""

So, recently I tried  to bring something nutritious in my ""diet"". I cannot stand boiled or  cooked eggs (taste), so I decided to make a ""protein"" shake that  consists of: 1 banana, 3 raw turkey eggs, a little bit of milk,  sometimes a little bit of sugar. I would mash the banana, stir (idk if  this is the correct term) raw eggs in a bowl, put the two together in a  bottle, add some milk, and then mix this and drink it all at once. I  made two of these milkshakes a day, but my body couldn't handle it.

After three days, I had bad stomach aches/cramps and was constipated. I had a mild diarrhea.

Is  there anything I  can do to stop my body's reaction? I wish I could  have something else in my diet as of now, but eggs are my only hope and  the only thing that I know I have a lot of. Down the line I would like  to add some oatmeal to my diet. I know that I should seek professional  help from nutritionists and professionals, but I cannot afford such  help."

0,"On March 23rd I had a meeting with my doctor for blood results and was told I was at 216 blood sugar and was 10 points off to becoming diabetic. He told me ""switch to diet soda"". Since 16 or 17 Ive been consuming 2 liters a day and eating tons of dollar menu fast food. Mcdonalds Hot N Spicy's, Jackass in the box tacos, Whoppers and chicken nuggets etc on top of chips everyday. I loved pringles and would eat a whole stack of pringles on the way home after work. 

So from then on eliminate all fast food (except Chipotle bowl without rice and beans), eliminated  all rice, pasta, bread and starchy or sugary veggies such as squash, corn, potatoes, carrots and peas. I cooked all meals at home and got rid of corn oils and only used grapesead and sometimes butter. Basically the only foods I eat since March 23rd are...  


Water/Diet Soda/Almond Milk/unsweet tea/white monster energy drinks (because white Rockstar has Malterodextin)  


Chicken, beef, pork, fish either fried or roasted in natural fats. Canned tuna/sardines. I bought lunch meat or pepperoni at stores while on the go as a snack. I also have eggs and bacon a lot for breakfast.   


Frozen broccoli florets, asparagus, onions, garlic, cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, bell peppers and serrano/jalapeno/pablano chillies and celery. Blueberries and strawberries.  


Sharp or extra sharp cheddar and swiss cheese as a snack.  Thats it. Pretty much all the way hippie besides the meat and cheese. I cut out regular milk and fruits because of the sugar. 

Im 33 male and after 7 weeks of this new diet I lost 35 pounds down to 277. The inflammation in my left foot is gone. My dandruff is gone and my anxiety is better. The only medication Ive been on the entire time is doxycycline since January 200mg a day prescribed by a dermatologist for achne on my back which I think was caused by high blood sugar.   


The past week Ive noticed my vision is blurry (its 20/20 close up but after 5 feet its blurry). So I figured its the aspartame in diet soda and swapped out Diet Dr Pepper for Zevia soda which is flavored by stevia. I don't touch Splenda because I found out it has malterodextin in it.   


Ive heard high blood sugar causes vision loss. And I heard sugar messes up your energy and memory. Why has my energy gotten worse and why hasnt my memory improved without the sugar? Is it the aspartame or something else?

I suffer from mild adult acne. I tried pretty much everything topical to no avail; retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and etc. as well as other things like drinking water and changing pillow case.

Is this normal with cauliflower, i.e. something with the high fiber content that I have to work up towards or something else like an intolerance?"

Can someone please answer some questions for me about white rice. I am so confused. There is so much contradictory information on the internet it is honestly so frustrating.

I am a marathon runner. I run a lot. I have been told that white rice is an excellent meal to consume before a 10-20 mile run because it fills your glycogen stores.

At the same time, people say that we need to be cutting ""refined sugars"" out of our diets...? Then they go as far as to refer to White Rice as a ""refined sugar"" like it's similar to a box of Mike and Ike's.

Isn't white rice simple brown rice with the germ removed? It's less calories and less nutritional value. Why are people demonizing it like it's eating candy? I understand all carbohydrates are sugar, but what gives?

Also, it's ""high on the glycemic index"" and thus if you eat it, it ""spikes blood sugar"" which can lead to chronic disease?

Is that just in the case of lazy people who smash rice and then lay on the couch and do nothing letting it turn into fat?

All of these questions and more. Please help me understand this damn food item. CAN I EAT IT AND GO RUN OR SHOULD I NEVER EAT IT AGAIN? Thanks for your knowledge and expertise.",Please someone help me understand White Rice.,"Please someone help me understand White Rice.

My diet consisted of fasting from 10pm to 2pm, breaking the fast with a soup, a meal made up of rice/protein/veggies, and a chia seed bowl (chia seeds, almond butter, fruit, honey) right before bed. With some healthy snacking throughout the day. I felt incredible on this routine!!!

But since March I’ve fallen off of that consistency and I’ve stopped following this diet mostly because grocery shopping has become too expensive for me to justify.

But now that I’m not watching what I eat and eating more casually (not eating junk food but also not eating super healthy either) I find my stomach is bothering me more now. 

Is it possible that I found the perfect diet for my body and that I can’t live any other way now? Is my body ‘rebelling’ against the crappier food I’ve been feeding it lately? Should I just bite the bullet and continue my former diet even if it is more expensive?

Just joined this subreddit, and I wanted to share something that I have found that I thought would be interesting to share with all of you.

“Effortless” and “weight loss” don’t seem like they belong in the same sentence.

At least that’s what I thought.

Until I read this FREE Ebook.

**file:///C:/Users/admin/Downloads/BioFit-Eat-for-8-2021.6%20(4).pdf**

In that Ebook, I learned about a few major breakthroughs in weight loss science that I had never heard of before.

And one of these breakthroughs actually allows you to eat all kinds of junk, and lose weight in the process.

How is that possible?

The creator of that Ebook is a genius. That’s how.

She’s at least 5 years ahead of where current weight loss science is...

And I LOVE his video...

So get focused.

Close the door.

And read this book until the very end... (and don’t skim read, give it a full read, trust me)

Your mind will be blown and you’ll start dropping pounds immediately afterward.

file:///C:/Users/admin/Downloads/BioFit-Eat-for-8-2021.6%20(4).pdf

Grilled cheese...

Sushi....

Doughnuts....

It’s all BACK on the table...

That’s why she calls it the “Favourite Food Diet”

I promise...a diet will never get easier than this...

It will never be more fun than this...

And as a result you’re going to STICK with this for the long haul.

That’s why she has so many incredible case studies to go along with his diet.

See them here...

0,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a 29yo 5 foot 10 male who started out weighing 254. I decided to start dieting the beginning of March. Since then I've dropped down to about 236 pounds but I seem to have hit a wall. I know the plateau is normal, i just had a couple of questions about how my exercise is impacting my weight loss.

Current calorie intake goal is to stay under 2k calories a day.

Before I started dieting I was basically sedentary for the last 5-6 years. I'm talking less than 5k steps a day and pretty much 0 exercising.

I started out going to the gym in March for about 30-45 minutes a day, 3 days a week. I'm now up to 5-6 days a week of going to the gym and doing aerobic exercises for 45minutes to an hour. I track everything on my samsung watch and I'm usually burning 500-650 calories everytime I go. So far I've really enjoyed it, I have minor soreness and some back pain but usually stretches and rest solve that issue.

My fiancee has continually said she's noticed the weight loss and can see where I've slimmed down (she's very supportive). But I've gotten a little frustrated by the actual lack of pounds lost. I know i should just focus on the health benefits of exercise and eating healthy (which I have been). It just seems like from all the stuff I've read that I should be atleast dropping a pound a week...and that hasn't been the case.

Just wanted to see if I'm doing something really wrong or if this is normal. My fiancee said that it's possible I'm just offsetting fat loss with muscle gain because I was so sedentary before, which makes sense, I just haven't been able to find sources out there claiming that that would happen at this high of a rate.

And insight or advice would be really appreciated.",Diet and Exercise,"Diet and Exercise Hi everyone,

I am new to this sub, so if this is not allowed please let me know and I will remove the post. I could not find anything in the rules regarding this.

Right now I am on a health journey because I cannot figure out what is wrong with my body. I am pescatarian. Since I was a kid I have become ill after eating meat. To the point where I would throw up sometimes. Now that I have the means to do so, I became pescatarian around 5 years ago. 

I did a food sensitivity test through my naturopath doctor along with some other tests. I have severe intolerances to gluten, dairy, and refined sugars eaten with fruit together along with an iron deficiency. This limits my options quite a lot. I am wondering if anyone has some meal recommendations that I can try? Meals that are high in iron? I just cannot eat fish and rice for the rest of my life. Does anyone have any recommendations for sites I can look on for finding meals I can eat that are healthy?

0,"Hey there internet. I won’t keep this message up to long but I needed to get this off my chest.

So me and weight loss have had a rough time together. A few years back I managed to lose 19lbs but I did it through very bad means. (800cal or less a day) and I can honestly say it was one of the worst times of my life. I’m only 20 but when I ate like this I would be constantly in a bad mood, super forgetful and cry at well everything. My grades dropped and I was tired all the time but I didn’t care cause my weight was going down. Every time I started eating a meal I would stop half way and feel sick if I ate any more. Luckily I got out of that routine but I then put on all the weight I had lost. 
I’ve tried dieting healthily but I never seem to last beyond 5lbs and it’s always back on within a month. 
So why start again now? Well I live at uni but recently visited home. I left a pair of underwear behind by mistake and my mother starting arguing my my brother that they belonged to his gf because they couldn’t possibly be mine because they were too small for me.
It kinda just hit me again that my family view me as fat. 
When I’ve tried loosing weight in the past it’s been for healthy reasons but this is the first time since the horrible diet trip that I’d be losing weight for a toxic reason. I know people will say I should ignore them and just be happy in myself but I can’t be. I’m scared it’s going to end up the same way it went before with me being very toxic toward myself and have my uni degree suffer because of how I eat. 
I just don’t know where to go from here.

Tldr: Mother implied I’m fat and scared to loose weight due to previous bad dieting experience.

So although I'm consuming around 40 grams of sugar per day, it's all from the food I'm eating, meaning, I don't believe it's added sugar.

0,"Long story short, I’ve eaten a terrible (normal) diet for my whole life. I’m 19 now. I’ve come to the realization that the back pain I’ve been experiencing in my upper right lat for 4 years and some other things is due to inflammation in my body caused by diet. I’ve been debilitatingly anxious since as long as I can remember.

(Skip to the last paragraph to get to the main point.)

When I eat something that doesn’t agree with me, I get ear ringing, constant anxious and depressive (sometimes suicidal) thoughts, get pale, etc., and genuinely overthink everything to the point where if I’m at a green light I’ll make sure there’s no imaginary signs I made up that doesn’t exist in case I’m violating a traffic law. Seriously it’s debilitating.

Last year I got severe cystic acne for about a year and it was dreadful. 100% caused by diet. Cleared up now, but I was eating junk for months on end at the time.

Over the last month, I haven’t been working, and in the mornings eat chocolate chip cookies with an iced coffee every morning. Lemonade throughout the day, big carb dish for dinner. I felt like I was going insane for the last month, I’ve been so anxious and doubting my every move, psychoanalyzing EVERYTHING that comes in my way. I noticed my feet actually started getting kind of tingly maybe three weeks in, and my hand was getting numb strumming my guitar. It was really concerning and thought I had a cardiovascular issue.

Now, four days ago, I stopped eating junk and just ate clean meat and some veggies from the fridge because I thought it might have to do with that. I felt really good, but that night I was home alone for dinner so I had 1/2 a lasagna and two ginger ales.

That night I started hallucinating, seeing actual faces. It was one of the worst feelings I’ve ever had. It was like I was just frozen in terror. The next day I was totally wiped out, angry and uber anxious to where I hid out in my room while my family was over for a birthday… Damn… it’s hard when you can’t break free from that anxious loop and it made me feel pretty bad.

The day after that, I was feeling 85% better in the morning. That day I only ate meat. I had a steak for lunch, and a steak for dinner. I felt like I was on top of the world. I wasn’t depressed or anxious at the end of the day, and my skin looks WAY red-healthier and my thoughts were super clear. I felt like I was an electric car. My back didn’t hurt, and was having meaningful conversations with my family.

I had three eggs later that night, felt wiped, right lat hurt, ear ringing, and body pains. So I was like hmm, well I’m in pain so I might as well make sure food particularly is causing me all of my issues. So I ate a big slice of chocolate cake. And I felt wiped. The next morning my depression and suicidal thoughts came back for the morning. I just sat there for an hour in the family room after falling asleep on the couch. In misery, unable to think for myself.

Today I’ve just eaten a steak for lunch and chicken wings for dinner. Felt pretty good but my head really hurts, I think it’s because I haven’t had a lot of sugar in a few days and I have an ear infection so that’s clearing up. Tonight I had some smoked turkey lunch meat. Back pain is back, stomach burns and is just growling. It’s not as anxious as the last time (I was afraid of leaving my house because of the thought of allowing those thoughts to fester into reality). Maybe the chemical smoke flavouring in the meat didn’t agree with me (it’s not food poisoning, all my symptoms are just back).

I am aware that there’s someone named Michaela Peterson who has had similar issues if not way worse symptoms, but I’ve noticed I exhibit almost scarily similar symptoms…. She went to only eating meat and salt and is now healthy. (as bullshit as it sounds, but if that can help me clear these issues up, just the possibility of that brings a tear to my eye).

Skip to here.

(If I eat anything other than meat, my depressive anxious loop thoughts come back and my back hurts and tinnitus and shoulder aches).

Even me writing this whole thing, I am thinking the reader will think I am over explaining everything and they are just gonna think I’m crazy sick. 

Basically, I think out of desperation because all of this is just too much for me to bear, I need to try to only eat meat, no additives, and just see how it works for me after a little bit, maybe a month. Does anyone have any similar experience with this? Any help here would be appreciated.",I’m not sure what’s wrong with me lol,"I’m not sure what’s wrong with me lol Long story short, I’ve eaten a terrible (normal) diet for my whole life. I’m 19 now.

I am aware that there’s someone named Michaela Peterson who has had similar issues if not way worse symptoms, but I’ve noticed I exhibit almost scarily similar symptoms…. She went to only eating meat and salt and is now healthy. (as bullshit as it sounds, but if that can help me clear these issues up, just the possibility of that brings a tear to my eye).

Skip to here.

(If I eat anything other than meat, my depressive anxious loop thoughts come back and my back hurts and tinnitus and shoulder aches).

Even me writing this whole thing, I am thinking the reader will think I am over explaining everything and they are just gonna think I’m crazy sick. 

Basically, I think out of desperation because all of this is just too much for me to bear, I need to try to only eat meat, no additives, and just see how it works for me after a little bit, maybe a month. Does anyone have any similar experience with this? Any help here would be appreciated."

I've been trying to get into a calorie deficit for about 2 weeks now. I've got some fat to lose.

I've found this supplement called glucomannan which is basically just fiber powder. It makes liquid super thick and it's basically got no calories.

I normally skip breakfast (I've never had a morning apatite) but then for lunch, I pour myself an Ensure Gold meal replacement into a 500ml glass (The Ensure is only 237ml) and then I refill the bottle with water and add some glucomannan and give it a shake. Then I mix the glucomannan water mix into the Ensure. I then top it off with a multivitamin. I have this at around 1pm and it keeps me full until around 5-7pm. 

&amp;#x200B;

For dinner, I normally always eat rice, meat, egg and vegetable.

270 lbs / 5'9

Hey guys, as the title suggests since 2019 I have made several attempts to try to lose weight. Each unsuccessful. I try many different diets. All these changes are initially successful, with me losing multiple lbs over the course of months, but I then go back to my ways eventually. I don't go on fad diets, all my diets are just based on portion control and watching calories.

My ""usual"" diet consists of me eating out. I usually eat out and eat very large restaurant portion sizes for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Most days I eat 2 large restaurant plates, and 3 on some days.

In my first attempt, I tried to use a delivery meal prep service. They came and delivered food. On the second attempt, I tried to cook for myself by going to the supermarket and cooking every day. On the third attempt, I tried to eat only meal-prepped chicken and rice for lunch and dinner and eggs for breakfast. This was the worst one, and this is the only diet change that lasted a week. I eventually started to stop tasting my food after the first week. Everything tasted like mush. On the fourth attempt, I used hello fresh to deliver my ingredients and recipes, so I don't have to go to the supermarket and just follow recipes rather than research what I want to eat that week.

I used myfitnesspal to keep track of my calories in/out. I also exercised with walks or biking.

All failed and I started to notice thse 3 similarities between each one

1. Hunger,  
After the first couple of months, I start to get very hungry. So hungry that even having a usual cheat meal (Just a regular restaurant meal on my normal diet) won't help alleviate it. I tried using coffee to suppress the hunger, but it just won't go down. This is usually my breaking point where I convert back to my original diet, so I won't stop feeling so hungry all the time.
2. Fatigue,  
I notice this 1-3 weeks before my unbearable hunger comes in. I become way more exhausted than usual. I usually have to get to bed immediately after 8 PM. This does help my sleeping schedule and I do get great sleep from this, but I do feel way more exhausted throughout the day.
3. Palette change,  
my palette changes consistently throughout the weeks. Eating the same meal for multiple weeks or the same 3 meals for the course of months will lead to my food tasting like mush. To the point, I won't eat or force myself to eat. Really takes out the fun of eating and makes me kinda miserable

Has anyone ever experienced this while changing their diet? If so, how have you guys been able to handle it?",Have failed attempts at weight loss multiple times since 2019,"Have failed attempts at weight loss multiple times since 2019

Good afternoon everyone!; Could you help me try to debunk these myths and doubts about food and nutrition? There are times when the surplus of available information makes it difficult to search in truly reliable sources. I thank you in advance. Happy weekend!

1. Do only carbohydrates increase blood sugar levels?

2) In an order from least to greatest feeling of satiety; Which macronutrient (fats, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, protein) makes you feel full longer?

3) In order from lowest to highest, which macronutrient (fats, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, proteins) most successfully delays the increase in blood sugar levels

4) It is already known for a fact that eating more frequently does not have a positive impact on our health (as long as you are consuming the necessary daily calories and as long as it is healthy food); well you may not be very hungry at the next meal, but again, this is not a problem if you eat healthy food. My question is, how true is it that if you eat very often food rich in carbohydrates, there is a chance of storing fat due to the action of insulin. Shouldn't this happen once your daily energy needs are met?

5) Does it make sense to eat just out of habit or because it's time to eat? Due to work schedules I get up a little late and I'm not hungry in the morning, and I consider it stupid to eat a snack at 11 a.m. and then have lunch at 12; what do you think is the most useful and easy to keep up with? I believe that eating out of habit can lead to poor food choices, not being able to distinguish the signs of real hunger and even worse, to a hormonal imbalance in terms of ghrelin and leptin

And finally, how true is the statement that to gain or lose weight you need to consume 500 kcal less /more per day? Does this really work like this way? Isn't it really necessary to have a chronic caloric surplus in order to ""get fat""? For example, if I ate 500 fewer calories per day, after a week I would have eaten 3,500 fewer calories, which is approximately what a normal weight and active person should consume in one day; would this really imply an increase of 1 kg of body fat?",Could you please help to cast a bit of certainty on these doubts regarding human nutrition?,"Could you please help to cast a bit of certainty on these doubts regarding human nutrition?

I know its not accurate, im just using to see what direction im going. I want to go on lowering bodyfat journey.

I have started using Lifesum app on my phone. i have set a goal for lowering my weight slowly. It puts me on 1600 calories to eat everyday. Thats fine.

Hi guys,  i would need your advice. 

I‘ve got a history of eating disorders and a huge part of my family has / had. While being anorexic as a teenager, I was overweight the last years.
Last year, I was able to loose weight in a healthy way and have reaches a good and healthy weight now, which I now try to keep.

On the one hand side I am still not 100% „good“ with my body, I love the number on the scale but would love to tone more and build a slight sixpack. Which would include weight gain, because of muscle gain. Now I think about loosing more weight before going into muscle gain. 
Hoping this way I‘d have both : the weight and the muscles.

On the other hand side, I want to be a good role model for my toddler. I want to be the generation of breaking ED habits for their kids. 
Now, how could I try to be a model for body positivity if I don’t go that way myself just yet?

And for dinner I had at least two servings of each, I feel stuffed.  So at not even half way to my recommended daily intake, what am I doing wrong?  I calculated everything correctly, the food was bland as I used no oil or spices so nothing to add there.

I’m new to dieting in general, so I feel like I’m missing something obvious."

So I’ve recently been recommended a lot of videos about fasting (surely has nothing to do with soaring food prices) and the topic definitely caught my attention.

Ideally, I’m looking to become more lean and have less body fat. I really want to hit this goal and I think my diet isn’t awful but I think it needs some improvements. I will give you a rough idea of what a day over the weekday looks like:

Breakfast: three eggs (usually scrambled with about a tablespoon of butter) and English breakfast tea with a splash of milk and no sugar.

Lunch: this varies a lot but when I’m trying to be really good it’s usually a chicken breast, lettuce, onion and a tablespoon of salad cream.

Dinner: Some form of lean meat - chicken breast, wit vegetables that might be in some kind of stir fry etc (I don’t use oil to cook my food due to the extra calories) and the sauces for my foods are made using fresh herbs rather than out of a jar.

Then some chocolate (my downfall) like a small Kit Kat with another cup of tea.

I’m fairly active, I go to the gym three times a week and do weight training and have an active job. I also walk to work most mornings which is about 2 miles.

Been weighing everything before preparing it, no take out, no junk food, only sugar I'm having is from apples, bananas, and the odd orange. Drinking nothing but lemon water4-6 bottles a day. I did the calorie calculator thing before I started and it suggested between 2800 and 3300 calories per day to lose weight. I set my calories goal to 2500 a day, I never go over that. Usually I'm between 1700 and 1900 calories per day rarely below 1700 or above 2000, I think my highest day was around 2100.

I ate well up until my parents speeperated and divorced when I was 10, after that I was eating a lot of convenience foods and junk. When I was 15-17 I played football in high school and was in the best shape of my life. Could run 8 minute miles, practically did every day and was doing serious weight training and strength conditioning 4-5 days out of the week, all of that combined with 3-4 hours of JV football practice 4-5 days a week. I wasn't absolutely shredded, and muscle builds on my body strangely since I have really long extremities. But I miss it. I know that degree of physical exertion is probably not healthy for me now, but I want to be more comfortable with my body be able to appreciate my body. 

I'm focused on weight loss primarily, and after I lose some body fat I want to make my gains back, at least to a certain extent.

 My question is what can y'all recommend? I know the basics, eat under your base metabolic rate by a little ( calculators tell me to maintain I should eat around 2,500 calories a day, not sure how accurate that is) so based on that, I should eat like 2,000-2,100 a day. Gotta reduce simple and complex carbs, but not eliminate them, don't over restrict and end up yo-yo-ing, a pound of fat is 3,500 calories, healthy weight loss is 1-2lbs a month, etc. 

But what meals can you recommend? What stuff is good to eat or include in meals that will help with satiety while helping me meet my weight loss and dieting goals? Would love to hear what you all currently eat or did that helped you in your journey.

The problem is I get fat quite easily around at 2200-2300 calories, which I'm not sure it's normal for my frame. I have good glucose is **4.59  mmol/l** and testosterone **8.82 ng/ml l** (top range is 8.70) and generally great health, except high LDL.

Do you have any idea, what additional blood work to do to, to look for the reason for gaining fat so easily? My body behaves like endomorph, but I have more like 'avatarish' (long bones)build with more fat..."

I eat now a lot healthier than year ago, more vegetables, more vitamins, more protein(1-2gxper 1kg of my weight) and also I take creatine monohydrate and turkesterone and some fat burners to suppress my appetite.

I started taking antidepressants and sleep meds year ago and 2 years ago I started going to therapy.

0," To add some context to the following information, I'm 18, male, 63.1kg/139.1lbs, and have been strength training on and off for the past 4 months as well as boxing for the same time period. My current diet macro split is 35%C, 35%P and 30%F, at 2453 k/cal which I've found puts me in a very slight caloric surplus (approx. +50 k/cal daily), my goal being body recompositing (gaining muscle and losing fat simultaneously). As I very well fall into the ""newbie gains"" category, have decent genetics and around 13-15% body fat I know that body recomp is possible for me, however my only concern is the foods I get my protein from.

My current strict diet I've made and adjusted over the last few weeks gives me 217g protein, 217g carbs and 74g fat, however I've calculated that 141g of that protein comes from whole foods, eggs = 12.7g, chicken breast = 35.6g, and tuna = 39.5, the remaining of that comes from things such as oats, rice, milk etc. I am concerned because that means I'm taking in 76g of my protein from whey protein shakes and protein bars, (2 scoops of whey per day 1 mixed with milk and 1 mixed in my oats, as well as 2 protein bars per day). Is this something I should be concerned about? Keep in mind money is not a problem so I can afford these supplements to keep this diet going for the long term, also I am getting more than enough fibre, potassium, vitamins, calcium and iron from this diet.

0,"Hey all, i've looked through this subreddit and found a couple of recipes for my diet loss journey but i still want to hear from anyone who would spare a few minutes.  
Basically i'm 24 y/o, 1.88m 103kg/~230lbs currently training and tracking my calories.  
Using the app myfitnesspal and for my goals i should limit to 2500 cal a day with my activity level (Training 3-4 times a week)
So my plan is to drop down to 90-94kg as that's the weight i feel and look good at.

My usual day looks like this:

Breakfast: 3 hard boiled eggs 
Lunch: Chicken breast on olive oil (no air fryer or any of those fancy pots that do not require any oil haha) with either lettuce/tomatoes/broccoli or something in that category
Snacks: Banana or apple and 200g some protein chocolate pudding (160cal with 20g protein on 200g of a container)
Dinner: This is where it gets tricky as i really have no dinner plans and i usually check my calorie count and give myself a 'cheat meal' in means of eating anything interesting as long as i don't push through calorie limit.  

With mentioned food i never go over 2000 cal per day, as is my idea to speed up the weight loss process, BUT i'm starting to lose my focus as i'm always eating the same things, preparing them the same way and experiencing the same tastes every day.  
I live in Serbia and all those fancy and weird recipes online really don't help because i either get lost or cannot track the calorie intake with them (i.e. don't know if something is good or bad for me to eat because of the difference in products in my country)  

So what are some good recipes i should and could try out, and is there anything in my diet i should change or add?  

Fair to mention, currently not using any supplementation but planning on taking a whey protein (to switch out protein pudding due to cost per month) and creatine (suggestion from a friend for higher volume in training as well in energy levels during the day) - so if anyone has an opinion on this i'd love to hear it!

0,"Hey, 

I'm trying to create a healthier food timetable for the week for myself. I intend to still do my own research after work but having a template from others more experienced to build off and further tailor to my situation would be helpful.

I don't take breakfast (although that could change depending on any advice given here) so I eat just twice a day -- mostly around 12:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. I use to take a lot of sugary drinks but I'm cutting down on them because they make me feel lethargic when I take them with a meal. 

I have 3 major things I'm looking for with my food timetable:

* I don't want to feel tired after each meal. Food coma has been a problem for a while. I eat and then for the next hour or even more after eating a meal, my cognitive abilities get affected.
* I want each meal to be filling for at least 4 hours. After 12:30 p.m. or 1 p.m., I'm not really looking to eat a meal again until 6. I'm open to snacking though.  
* I want to make sure I'm not deficient in nutrients and that each day I'm eating something well rounded. 

Now, on to what I have available to me each day. I live in a developing country so I don't have a lot of options available. The standard meal I can get each day includes:

* White rice (Parboiled long-grain rice white rice)
* Beans 
* Chicken 
* Beef
* Fish
* Eggs (boiled or fried)
* Beef and chicken sausages 
* A salad
* Yams 
* Spaghetti with a sauce
* Noodles (Instant noodles; stir fry)
* Bread (sugar bread)
* Fruits are also available (Pineapples, oranges, apples, watermelons, etc.)

**Note: These options can be combined in a variety of ways and there are other things I left out to avoid cluttering this post.** 

If you can't do a Monday - Sunday timetable, I'd appreciate pointers on what needs to be part of each meal, the ratios to prevent food coma, and any other theories on nutrition I can use to tailor it down. 

**If it's of any importance, I'm not a very active guy but I've resolved to take evening walks and jog at least once a week for the next month.** 

Thank you in advance.",I need your help,"I need your help Hey,

I’ve just been recently diagnosed with fibro and was wondering the best diets for it. I have seen lots online re keto, low carb diets etc. I’m not sure what is the best out there to try…?

I usually track all food, eat a well balanced diet and go between weight loss/maintenance. I did keto many years ago and loved it but eventually stopped because it did not feel sustainable long term. However I’m willing to try anything to help reduce my pain and symptoms.

Been lifting in the gym hard, but due to my lack of cardio and I suspect diet, I've gained some nasty stomach fat/love handles. Will start doing more cardio when the weather stabilizes in the 60s, in the meantime, how can I improve my diet. Here is the rundown:

**Work Days**

* Breakfast: Apple w/peanut butter and a protein bar.
* Lunch: Italian Deli Sandwich w/ Ruffles Hot Chips
* Before Workout: Bowl of Pasta w/ red sauce and parmesan cheese

**Days From Home/Weekends**

* Breakfast: Scrambled eggs on a bagel, apple w/ peanut butter, smoothie, oatmeal with honey.
* Lunch: Ellios Pizza, 2 slices or pasta

* Dinner Rotation: Salmon w/rice, Chicken Stir Fry (w/ red peppers, broccoli, rice), Pasta w/ Mussells, Leftover stir fry w/ baked beans, Tacos (w/ ground beef, cheese, rice, spinach, hot sauce).  

Smoothies is either banana (Banana, cocoa powder, Cabot Vanilla Greek Yogurt, almond milk) or pomegranate (pomegranate juice, Cabot Vanilla Greek Yogurt, strawberries, blueberries). Used to have them twice a day, cut down to once.

Will sometimes have ice cream as a dessert, the deals at my grocery store are crazy but am willing to drop it, or at least only buy a pint a week.  

I'm great at sacrificing foods, I'm just uninformed as to what to sacrifice. If there's anything easy and healthy to make, I'm all ears, as well as if I need to drop anything or improve on something. Would love a suggestion for a healthy snack to replace the ice cream.

This is an issue i’ve had my entire life, and i am incredibly embarrassed by it. but now that i live on my own, i have learned how unhealthy my eating habits are. If it helps, i’ve always had very bad anxiety and have recently started being medicated for it. that may be a factor but i don’t know.

Foods have always been tough for me and super embarassing to the point where i couldnt eat in front of people for a while. I’ve always been a picky eater. Could never drink juices and sodas, and had to learn to deal with milk. Could never really do mashed potato’s, chinese food outside of plain chow mein, sushi, mexican food outside of cheese quesadillas and burritos with only beans cheese and rice, and have always liked my burgers plain. just now recently starting to like rice. The thought of apple sauce makes me want to vomit. Growing up, i would have vegetables and stuff at dinner and could not get them down, yet was forced to stay at the dinner table until i finished my plate. i absolutely depise the taste/texture of all vegetables, especially broccoli and asparagus. carrots, too. i don’t know what it is, but that bitter taste triggers me and instantly makes me gag. the last time i had broccoli, i threw it all back up. 

I cant do many fruits either. I kinda like bananas, but that’s really it. Oranges and stuff are way too bitter and sour for me, grapes, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries all have this really gross sweetness and texture that make me physically repulse. i love strawberry FLAVORED things, but strawberries themselves are a no go. apples also make me incredibly nauseous, due to its weird unfulfilling, almost flat kind of taste. Avocado i hear is really great, and i’d be willing to try it cuz i kind of like guacamole.

Between March 2020 (covid 🙄) - January 2022 I gained back about 40-45 lbs. 

So since the beginning of this year, I’ve been following a very strict diet and exercising 4 days a week (at least 45 minutes per session, usually HIIT cardio and strength training). I’m still pretty much eating keto (less than 39 Net carbs per day) with a protein goal of 97g per day and between 1000-1200 calories per day. I’ve lost about 15 pounds so far.

The problem is, I can easily be full and satisfied on less than 800 calories per day. I never used to even count calories on keto before but I’m trying to be more conscious of it now and I know that eating too little can stall weight loss just as well as eating too much.

I'm currently trying to shred body fat, but I'm concerned nothing is happening...

It's been approximately 2 weeks and the scales have stayed at 70kg (172cm tall btw).

My diet consists of a variation of the same food items every day, and I never cheat. Not even a single chip. These food items are; Eggs, Green/Red Peppers, Carrots, Chicken, Light Greek Yoghurt, Strawberries, Bananas, Raisins, Oats, Protein Powder. 

I weigh absolutely everything, so my calorie count shouldn't be off, and even if it is ever so slightly off, my 2 week average is 1100 calorie intake. (I still get over 150g of protein in every day)

I do approx 2 hours gym every day, so maybe I'm gaining muscle and losing fat at the same rate? But still, I'm not noticing any huge changes in my body physique so I'm getting a bit despondent....

Does anyone have any tips for shredding body fat?

My diet consists of a variation of the same food items every day, and I never cheat. Not even a single chip. These food items are; Eggs, Green/Red Peppers, Carrots, Chicken, Light Greek Yoghurt, Strawberries, Bananas, Raisins, Oats, Protein Powder. 

I weigh absolutely everything, so my calorie count shouldn't be off, and even if it is ever so slightly off, my 2 week average is 1100 calorie intake. (I still get over 150g of protein in every day)

I do approx 2 hours gym every day, so maybe I'm gaining muscle and losing fat at the same rate? But still, I'm not noticing any huge changes in my body physique so I'm getting a bit despondent....

Does anyone have any tips for shredding body fat? 

For background; I used to be 125kg and lost it all through heavy calorific deficit and cardio, but I've been 70kg for about 8 months now whether I eat like a horse or go into heavy calorific deficit. I'm honestly dumbfounded."

0,"Hello, I'm genuinely at a loss as what to do about my current weight gain. I feel like I've tried everything including seeking health advice from professionals but I've just been dismissed as ""not a medical issue"". This is really starting to depress me so posting here on the off chance someone else has been through similar.

My background:
- Obese my entire life, 125kg at highest, 5ft 8
- 2017 started the keto diet. Lost weight rapidly.
- August 2019 I was at 75kg. Went on a month long holiday to east Asia, came off Keto for the trip. Despite lots and lots of exercise (including climbing Mount fuji) came back as 82kg. Note in order to get down to 75kg I was doing some extreme fasting 5 days a week of no food or calories... I do wonder if I messed up my metabolism. 
- Unable to shift weight from 82-83kg... Not too fussed as still pretty low and healthy
- Covid hits the UK in March 2020. From this point onwards I'm on and off Keto... Mainly because it was necessary, the original few months were crazy with food shortages etc. Despite this my weight stays at around 83kg
- June 2020 I have a tummy tuck and gynecomastia surgery. This was planned for a while to get rid of excess skin and the man boobs I had always had.
- Post op: bizzarely about 87kg. After 2 weeks I go back on full keto
- Steady weight gain since then, any time I come off keto for Christmas or Chinese New Year say, even the odd day or two, I put on weight. I then don't seem to be able to lose any weight.
- Current weight 97kg... In the past two years I have put 10kg back on and I'm desperate to lose it but nothing is happening.

My diet!:
- I am still on strict keto
- I restrict myself to 1500 calories a day but often is lower than this
- I fast a lot, Infact I barely eat, its usually OMAD
- I take vitamin suppliments
- I've tried all sorts, apple cider vinegar each day, microbiome pills for healthy gut, no change
- I'm active, in the gym, I play football once a week, generally walk everywhere and tend to do long walks once or twice a week (15km+). I've just got a new bike so will be using that this summer too. 
- I have tried other diets that aren't low carb, most recently I tried a standard Western diet with calorie counting alongside ADF. so I would eat 1500-1600 calories of a standard diet Inc healthy carbs, fruits and veg one day and then not eat the next. This ballooned me up to the current 97kg and I now look noticeably bigger and my clothes don't fit.

I'm at a 25% bf and I'm trying to cut down at least south of 18% for the summer.

So, my only option is to either increase my carb or protein intake. 
The issue with increasing protein it’s that ever since I’ve been lean bulking and increasing my calories by 100 every two weeks, I’ve reached a point where, being on a clean diet, I don’t know how I can eat so much protein! 
I drink protein powder shakes with milk twice a day, eat a large amount of meat every day, but it’s become boring. 
I think I’d find it easier to increase carbs, the “clean” kind, than increasing protein, so I can reduce my fat intake. 
But if eating more carbs than protein would affect muscle growth, I could try to fix something but please let me know your experience if you’ve been eating more carbs than protein as a trainer.","As a bodybuilder/strength/resistance trainer, should I consumer more protein than carbs for maximum benefit?","As a bodybuilder/strength/resistance trainer, should I consumer more protein than carbs for maximum benefit?

I am currently on a weight loss journey. I managed to drop 16kg, from 122kg down to 106kg in the most unhealthy way imaginable. I ate what i wanted but restricted my caloric intake to 1000 calories a day. It worked up until now. I have been stuck at my current weight for a month or two. Can’t seem to lose more weight. People have explained to me that i mainly lost water weight and how i put my body in starvation mode. I feel like Dr. Now would laugh at me if i told him that, but it’s probably true. What do i know?

I don’t have the money required to hire a dietitian, so i was wondering if anyone here would be willing to assist me in figuring out what i need to eat to get my daily dose of carbohydrates, fats, proteins and calories?

I have installed the ‘my fitness pal’ application on my cellular device, but i find that application overwhelming as well. 

Again, I apologize if i have broken your subreddit’s rules by asking this. I have to admit, to my shame, that i have not read the rules. I ask you not to be too harsh if i did break your rules, because i am desperate for help. I do not want to develop an eating disorder. I do not want to gain back all that i have lost either. I would very much like to be able to wear my bikini this summer, but I doubt that will be happening.

While I’ve been passively trying to lose weight, I have not gone on a “diet” since last year. Even so, up until recently, I’ve been  losing a couple lbs here and there—inconsistently—but weight loss is weight loss.

However, due to spring break and having downtime, I’ve started habitually eating more food. On top of this, my dance team is on its off season and I am not working out as much. 

My irritation with my slow, inconsistent weight loss combined with this fear of developing habits that will make me gain weight made me decide to start a diet. My version of “dieting” is honestly just having a calorie cap. I don’t track macros, but I try to have a good balance of protein and carbs.

My calorie cap is 1800 calories, but I will sometimes eat less—how much I eat is 100% tied to how busy I am so the amount of daily calories I intake are anywhere from 1400-1800.

To lose about 0,55 lbs or 0,25 kg each week (don't want to lose more each week, too hard) I'd have to eat about 2100 kcals each day. i've not been able to hit this target for days because of that constant hunger feeling. So I always overeat this target. My diet looks like this to cut down to 61 kg:

\- Breakfast:

I mostly eat weetabix original (wheat) with skimmed milk and like an apple or so. I also really like some pudding with high protein sometimes.

\- Lunch:

Low-fat yoghurt (750g/1.65 lbs, find this quite filling because of the volume) + like 300g/,66 lbs of canned veggies. Mostly peas, beans, corn or macedoine of vegetables.

\- Dinner:

Now this is probably something I can improve, but for dinner I eat Huel Hot &amp; Savoury. About 3 scoops which comes around to about 600 kcals. 

During the day to fill up calories, I just eat lots of variaties or fruits really. And something like canned tuna to make sure I hit 2 grams of protein per kg of bodyweight. But like I said, I'm having trouble surpressing hunger which makes me overeat my goal of 2100 kcals. There are probably some foods or healthy snacks I can eat to cope with this more easily? But which ones? Any tips for this? I can probably improve my dinner aswell, since Huel isn't really whole foods so less filling I assume.",Trouble surpressing hunger during cutting phase,"Trouble surpressing hunger during cutting phase Hi,

Whenever I try to search up info on decent meals and diets, I instantly get blasted with extremely healthy meal guides that require complex cooking and meal prep and attention. 

I'm a fucking college student and could not give less of a shit about actually eating super healthy, I just want to have a diet that gives me everything I need to survive. Right now I practically eat no vegetables, only eat fruit occasionally, eat frozen pre-cooked foods constantly, and have zero understanding of any kitchen devices besides an oven and a microwave.

So I'm just here looking for resources and advice on how to start a reasonable diet. Not some over the top shit, just a passable and average meal plan that will give me everything I need but not too much more. If anyone has any resources that would help for what I am looking for, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance."

some of my other friends are bothered by the food as well like it hurts their stomach, but it doesn’t make them gain weight or break out. what’s going on with my body?

anyone have ideas as to what’s in the food/what the issue w my body is?"

Breakfast (8:30am): eating (a little less than) 1/2 cup of rice + whatever my family had for dinner the night before (usually meat like chicken, beef, pork) OR 1/2 cup of rice + corned beef, spam etc.

Lunch (12:30pm): eating 1/4 cup of rice + meat (like chicken, beef, pork)

Afternoon snack(4pm): only going to drink about 300ml juice (fit n right, minute maid, dutch mill, stuff like that)

then, i exercise at 5pm. i ride the bike for 40 mins and brisk walk for 20 mins.

Dinner (7pm): I eat plate of vegetables + protein (like cabbage w/ egg or spinach w/ ground pork)

Bedtime snack (10pm): fruits + low fat milk OR fruits + almond milk

So far, I'm three days in and have encountered only a few problems. 1/2 cup of rice seems to be too much for me, so I'm thinking about whether to change my breakfast into 1/4 cup rice (same as my lunch). However, I'm worried I'll end up being tired for when I exercise. Any suggestions?

I’ve been trying on and off for months to get into shape and stop being “skinny fat”. My main problem is not the workouts, it's the food. I weigh 67kg at 180cm and want to eat around 3000 calories during my bulk. My problem is that I neither have time to prepare 3k worth of clean food nor do I have the stomach to consistently chew it down on a daily basis. 

It’s just a lot easier buying two double cheese at McDonald to get my last 1000 calories than to cook 3 chicken breasts and half a cup of rice after work. + One I can eat on the bus ride home while the other I have to force-feed myself for two hours before I’m able to eat it all(when I really should be sleeping). 

My problem has always been under-eating. I see my weight go down in the months I don't exercise. Would I just be better of eating 3000 calories of shit food and protein powder, and just losing the weight again whilst eating clean during my cutting period?

It’s just a lot easier buying two double cheese at McDonald to get my last 1000 calories than to cook 3 chicken breasts and half a cup of rice after work. + One I can eat on the bus ride home while the other I have to force-feed myself for two hours before I’m able to eat it all(when I really should be sleeping). 

My problem has always been under-eating. I see my weight go down in the months I don't exercise. Would I just be better of eating 3000 calories of shit food and protein powder, and just losing the weight again whilst eating clean during my cutting period? (Worth noting that I intend on eating vechables, frutes and fish for the micros. I enjoy cooking in my spare time. Just not for 40 minutes at 21:00 every night when I want to go asleep)"

I wasn't *too* muscular, but had some muscle. 200lbs at 5'8 is pretty fat for me. (I'm someone who is told I look like I weigh less than I do. I get told I'm ""solid"", usually ""like a wrestler"".) I've gotten up to 290lbs before (*probably* only looked 250lbs at the time). I was in a group home and was eating all the food they gave me. So I decided to eat just as much mashed potatoes and rice and other stuff that I needed. Got down to 240lbs, I think, in just a *few* months. Then I shot back up to 270lbs. When I got out (May 8th, 2021), I moved in with my mom and brother who took care.of my paralyzed sister. That was hell for 3 to 4 weeks; eating once a day, where I'd been eating 3 times a day at the group home. By the time I left, I was 250lbs. As of yesterday, I am 219lbs. Ever since May 8th of last year (2021), I've been eating just *once* a day. It is either 3 or 4 eggs, 2 burgers from Walmart, or some boneless and skinless chicken breasts. I rarely add seasoning (high blood pressure -and I actually enjoy ""bland"" food). However, I've only lost 31 lbs in about 9 or 10 months, or so. I *am not* trying to starve to lose weight. I *am* trying to ""starve"" to prepare my body for hell.... actually. Basically, I bart eat because I think I'll get no food after I die and go to hell. Strange to think about to an outsider, I know (I believe in a physical hell).

During those 10 months that I lost 50lbs without trying, I ate.just once a day and would drink about three 24oz 211 Steel Reserves a night for 3 to 5 nights week. I *did* still do my workout program, which consisted of simple calisthenics for a few sets (maxing out each set). I'd usually workout about 4 or 5 hours after waking, then eat my single meal for the day.

Nowadays, I do NOT workout (weights or calisthenics). I eat once a day. And I am a *heavy* drinker now. About 4 or 5 24oz 211's a night for 20 nights out of a month. So, drinking heavily for 2/3 of the month. No exercise.

I do know 1 drink with food becomes fat. And 3 drinks or more with NO food becomes fat. (Carbs.) I don't run, I don't do bodyweight work (for about a year now) and don't lift weights. Completely sedentary. 

Is this normal to have only lost 31lbs? Should I maybe add *some* movement to help in weight loss? I'm not *activy* trying g to lose weight, but kinda wish that almost no food would've made me at least 60lbs by now. (And yes, I do know the beer is a major factor. But I won't slack off.

So obviously this has probably had an effect on why I’m underweight

I just eat oats with milk and add some fruits to it sometimes for breakfast. For lunch, I have been consuming the same amount of food like I usually do. But, I feel strangely full afterwards. Feels as if I had just returned from a feast. The amount I consume for dinner is also proper, and more or less what I used to have before."

I was very thin a couple years back, but going off of adderall, going on a new antidepressant that caused weight gain, and the lockdown leading to me become much less active than before led to me gaining nearly 30 pounds withing only a few months. 

Between then and now I've lost 10 pounds, but it just seems like I'm stuck at this weight no matter what I do. I feel like antidepressants and other medication arent making me gain weight anymore but are not allowing me to lose any more

My diet compared to when I was thin was less healthy than the one I'm on now and I probably ate a bit more back then too. 

I guess I just want an opinion on if I'm not losing much weight bc of my antidepressants and mood stabilizers. I know weight gain is one of the common side effects of more than one of the medications I'm on. But not being to lose any more (or only losing very little) is not what I normally hear but its driving me mad

0,"I've always been a picky eater and have struggled with eating vegetables and know I am never getting the number of servings and nutrition I need daily. I also live a very active lifestyle working out 4-5 times a week and going to jiu-jitsu around the same. Lately, I've been getting very fatigued after really hard workouts(sometimes even catching a cold) and can feel my body doesn't have what it needs to properly recover. I was able to get away with it when I was real young but now being 28 maybe it's catching up to me.  


I've just started a new daily routine of pushing to get those servings of vegetables in with shakes. From what I've read online the most important part is eating uncooked whole vegetables. So what I've been doing lately is having a shake of Athletic Greens(AG1) when I first wake up, then after my morning workout I make a shake that consists of water, 1-2 cups of kale, 1-2 cups of spinach, 1 cup of broccoli, then I also add 3 scoops of Subi veggie mix because it makes the smoothie taste great,  a cup of frozen berries, and a scoop of Progressive VegeGreen.  


What I am mostly wondering is if this is a good daily routine or will it still not make up for not eating many vegetables during my meals. I'm not exactly sure the number of services in those smoothies but the Subi product says 4+ servings per scoop(So 4 \* 3 = 12 services), plus a scoop of the Progressive VegeGreens, plus 3-5 cups of raw veggies. I am not sure if since I drink it, or have all that in one sitting that may be a lot of it may go to waste as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I also read on the Progressive VegeGreen bottle that you should consult a doctor if you use it continuously for over 12 weeks. So it made me wonder if there were issues with using those products long-term and a lot, or if it was just for people with rare conditions.  


So yeah if you have any thoughts or insight that would be great! I do really enjoy spinach and can enjoy spinach wraps or salads but outside of that, it's always has been a struggle to consume more. If you have any advice please let me know as well!

0,"Just a thought i had. So basically, all forms of carbs are broken to glucose on your body. Considering the average person consumes about 250-300 grams of carbs per day, that would mean your body can handle the amout of glucose that 250-300 grams of carbs are being broken into daily, like in terms of insulin production and avoiding insuling resistance.

So, if i were to cut out all forms of carbs other that white sugar (Sucrose) from my diet, will i be able to eat alot of sucrose per day (more than the recommended anount which is about 25-30 grams per day) because the overall amount of glucose my body will have to be dealing with will stay remain the exact same?

0,"I've been vegetarian since I was fourteen. I decided to cut out meat because I didn't like supporting companies that treated their animals poorly, but more importantly, many meats (most fish and pork) make me very ill. At the time, I had no reason why I couldn't. I had no dietary restrictions and I was a healthy weight.

In the three years since, I've gained nearly 50lbs (though I've also grown five or so inches, so take that with a grain of salt). I'm currently 5'3 and consistently weighing in at 164lbs. I had a very rough time during quarantine and the eating disorders I've dealt with on and off since I was young ran rampant.

I've also learned that I have food allergies. I'm mildly allergic to wheat, cow's milk, sesame, strawberries and shrimp. I have not had an opportunity to cut those out yet, and my diet mainly consists of dairy and wheat.

I've tried to lose weight on and off for years. I've tried healthy ways and I've tried unhealthy ways. But I never lost much, two or three pounds at most.

I feel ill most days. Granted, I'm chronically ill, but I feel absolutely awful and I have to wonder if my diet is playing a large role in that. I'm constantly bloated and I'm constantly vomiting everything I've eaten. I deal with protein deficit as well.

I'm starting to think it would be better for my health and weight to begin eating meat again. I know from previous attempts that I can't digest meat properly anymore, so I would have to reintroduce it very gradually, but if that's what I need to stop feeling so bad.

I don't even care about my appearance anymore like I used to - I don't care about weight loss in that sense. I just want to have a good night's sleep again without feeling like I'm going to vomit my entire stomach up. I just want to feel better.

Would this be safe, given my current state? I clearly have a very sensitive stomach, and I already know I can't handle much meat anymore.

Can someone give me an idea of what my current diet is giving me and what I still need, nutrition wise?

So the following is probably TMI but I am going to throw it out there hoping someone can help me figure out the best diet I can from these foods, and slowly work my way up to adding new dishes if necessary (it probably is. or maybe I can just take a multi-vitamin? Would hiring a nutritionist help me organize and analyze this data?)

I have food issues in that most things taste bad or put me off, so I have a limited diet of things I can tolerate, and I tend to eat the same things every day (also for convenience as I can only cook super-basic things like soups, grilled cheese sandwiches or omelets). 

If anyone can help me, I am a 35 female weighing 125 pounds, 61 inches tall. From what I've figured out, my daily calorie intake is presently 1550/day\*. 

Breakfast every day is cheerios (original version), skim milk, banana. Lunch Monday-Friday is peanut butter\*\* on white bread\*\*\*, and a side of raisins (2 boxes so 180 calories). I should probably add a fruit cup. Know any premade healthy ones I can get at the grocery store? (edit: google says I can make my own but coat it in citrus juice to preserve it over the week. But all the prep sounds like a pain, so if there are good pre-made ones at the store, let me know). \*\*\*\*

I tend to skip lunch on weekends. 

Dinner I can vary more conveniently. I either like things I can pop out of the box and pop into the oven, or make on the weekend and reheat over the workweek. I am a vegetarian (mostly). Lately, I've been heating pre-made store-bought cheese and spinach quiche in the oven, and veggie spring rolls (no sauce). I can't tell if the veggies make it healthy or if the vehicle cancels out any health benefits of the veggies. 

I completely cut out snacks such as cookies and ice cream I also enjoy. I want to work them back into my life after I lose 10-15 pounds. I also started an exercise program beginning of February and am improving slowly but surely. 

On the weekend I also sometimes make omelets with green and red peppers and onion and a side of sweet potato for the week (just butter, salt, pepper added to the potato). Other such meals/sides can be steamed broccoli and a touch of butter. I like a snack of cashews. I like mushroom barley soup (restaurant bought, convenient but expensive) and matzo ball soup (homemade, cheap but inconvenient, lol). I like a spinach-base salad with carrots, cucumbers, cabbage, and onions mixed in. Vinaigrette dressing. 

Of fruits, I like apples, banana, cantaloupe, cherries, grapes, oranges, peaches, strawberries, tangerines. I am trying to learn to like tomatoes. Right now I find them gross, but I will keep adding them to my salad as I'm told they're very healthy. 

Of veggies, I like asparagus, green beans, broccoli, red cabbage, carrot, cauliflower (when made into a pizza crust that they no longer sell at my local, so I can't eat it anymore and it is probably also an unhealthy vehicle for eating cauliflower anyway), cucumber, edamame, mushrooms, red onion, green and red pepper, sweet potato, spinach, zucchini. 

Can't think what else I eat that's healthy. 

The only meats I like are the unhealthy ones: bacon, salami, hot dog. (I've cut these out of my diet). The rest smell bad, taste bad, and feel bad on my tongue (texture issues). Ditto fish or other seafood. I wasn't kidding about food issues. 

\*I cut out the Gatorade and Fritos (which meant 300 calories less/day and removing about 80% of my sugars). 

\*\*In an effort to improve my diet I switched from Peter Pan Creamy PB to Smucker's Natural 

\*\*\*I used to eat honeywheat bread but the preservatives apparently make it just as unhealthy as white bread, so I switched back to white

\*\*\*\*Breakfast and lunch, at least during the work week, are almost non-negotiable for me as I need a breakfast that is quick and easy (I am so not a morning person and I do most of the set-up the night before), and a lunch I can pack to work that can be eaten cold or room temp.

I completely cut out snacks such as cookies and ice cream I also enjoy. I want to work them back into my life after I lose 10-15 pounds. I also started an exercise program beginning of February and am improving slowly but surely. 

On the weekend I also sometimes make omelets with green and red peppers and onion and a side of sweet potato for the week (just butter, salt, pepper added to the potato). Other such meals/sides can be steamed broccoli and a touch of butter. I like a snack of cashews. I like mushroom barley soup (restaurant bought, convenient but expensive) and matzo ball soup (homemade, cheap but inconvenient, lol). I like a spinach-base salad with carrots, cucumbers, cabbage, and onions mixed in. Vinaigrette dressing. 

Of fruits, I like apples, banana, cantaloupe, cherries, grapes, oranges, peaches, strawberries, tangerines. I am trying to learn to like tomatoes. Right now I find them gross, but I will keep adding them to my salad as I'm told they're very healthy. 

Of veggies, I like asparagus, green beans, broccoli, red cabbage, carrot, cauliflower (when made into a pizza crust that they no longer sell at my local, so I can't eat it anymore and it is probably also an unhealthy vehicle for eating cauliflower anyway), cucumber, edamame, mushrooms, red onion, green and red pepper, sweet potato, spinach, zucchini. 

Can't think what else I eat that's healthy. 

The only meats I like are the unhealthy ones: bacon, salami, hot dog. (I've cut these out of my diet). The rest smell bad, taste bad, and feel bad on my tongue (texture issues). Ditto fish or other seafood. I wasn't kidding about food issues. 

\*I cut out the Gatorade and Fritos (which meant 300 calories less/day and removing about 80% of my sugars). 

\*\*In an effort to improve my diet I switched from Peter Pan Creamy PB to Smucker's Natural 

\*\*\*I used to eat honeywheat bread but the preservatives apparently make it just as unhealthy as white bread, so I switched back to white

\*\*\*\*Breakfast and lunch, at least during the work week, are almost non-negotiable for me as I need a breakfast that is quick and easy (I am so not a morning person and I do most of the set-up the night before), and a lunch I can pack to work that can be eaten cold or room temp. (No microwaves in the office). 

Thanks in advance if you've made it this far!"

I think I’ve been pretty successful here, but for some reason I can’t get rid of my stubborn minor belly fat, and would like my body to look more toned… as of now I can definitely tell a difference, but I feel like it should be more given how much time I’ve put into weightlifting. I also do cardio every day (walk my dogs for anywhere between 1-3 miles/ day) and at the gym I do cardio before my lifting sessions.

0,"\--- CONTEXT ---

I always viewed (and still do) weight loss as CICO. With this simple ""knowledge"", I one day deiced to lose weight (when I hit my highest ever weight of 103kg) and applied this ""knowledge"" by very loosely measuring how much calories I'm eating and limited that to around 500-1000 less (depending on day) than what an online calculator told me my daily intake should be. With no exercise and practically zero change in my diet (apart from volume), I went to my current weight (83kg) which I'm feeling a lot better about.

After that point, I stopped ""trying"" to diet, though I still roughly watch how much I eat, usually I don't watch at all and just eat until I'm full. I've been living like this now for around half a year or so, and am staying at my weight for the most part. Sometimes I go to 85kg (like today), and I've also dropped to as low as 79kg before (don't know if such a broad range of weight is normal, but I can go up / down by 2kg or more in a single day).

I've now ""normalized"" a weight of 83kg as the default and would like to start ""trying"" again to get to my original goal (\~73kg).

I think it will be a lot harder to lose this weight, even if it's technically less, because I limiting many calories now will take more effort than it did when I was essentially over-eating in the first place, and am thinking of incorporating some dietary choices which I want to make permanent because I believe unless it's effortless to do, I won't stick to it (because keeping to my eating times and portions is the maximum effort I can stick to when I'm trying).

\--- CURRENT DIET ---

My current diet is only water when it comes to drinking and whatever I want to eat as long as it's vegetarian. Usually consume very little sugar, because it consistently gives me pimples, but sometimes I still eat some cookies / piece of cake / etc...

On my typical day, I will skip breakfast and eat one meal when I get home. on average I'd say I eat at around 16:00 (4PM).  
This is how all my days look when I start trying again, but right now I don't stick to this regime because I'm lazy.

\--- WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR ---

I'm looking for easy things to eliminate indefinitely from my diet that don't dramatically decrease my choice of food or make me do any special work to avoid it, because of the reason mentioned above, but are extremely effective when it comes to resulting in me consuming less calories because of it.

I've now ""normalized"" a weight of 83kg as the default and would like to start ""trying"" again to get to my original goal (\~73kg).

I think it will be a lot harder to lose this weight, even if it's technically less, because I limiting many calories now will take more effort than it did when I was essentially over-eating in the first place, and am thinking of incorporating some dietary choices which I want to make permanent because I believe unless it's effortless to do, I won't stick to it (because keeping to my eating times and portions is the maximum effort I can stick to when I'm trying).

\--- CURRENT DIET ---

My current diet is only water when it comes to drinking and whatever I want to eat as long as it's vegetarian. Usually consume very little sugar, because it consistently gives me pimples, but sometimes I still eat some cookies / piece of cake / etc...

On my typical day, I will skip breakfast and eat one meal when I get home. on average I'd say I eat at around 16:00 (4PM).  
This is how all my days look when I start trying again, but right now I don't stick to this regime because I'm lazy.

\--- WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR ---

I'm looking for easy things to eliminate indefinitely from my diet that don't dramatically decrease my choice of food or make me do any special work to avoid it, because of the reason mentioned above, but are extremely effective when it comes to resulting in me consuming less calories because of it.

Thank you"

I am a M(27) 6' 5"" weighing 206. My goal weight is 190.

Those familiar with the app My profile is:


Moderate goal (1lb off a week)

My question is, should I up my calorie deficit?

Also, I walk around 10k steps a day and work warehouse were I lift heavy bales of hay and bags of grain all day. Would this be classified as ""Moderately active""? Or ""slightly active""?

After learning about healthy eating I saw that I needed more fats, proteins and fibres in my diet.

So back in January I changed my diet, I started taking an orange every morning with breakfast which made me full quicker, making me eat less bread. I also ate some sprouts and other fruits with each meal to increase my fibre intake.

I felt a bit drained a day or 2 so I added more protein (maybe it wasn't a lot but I was just beginning to change). And after the third day I started feeling the changes.

If I didnt have to plan, prepare, cook, and invest a huge amount of time strategizing on what to eat, and had it all ready to go quickly, I would be okay. If i didnt feel a huge energy deficit and craving, I would have a shot. Is there anything like that in 2022, something that gives you all the nutrients and also makes you feel satiated? I dont need it to taste like cheeseburgers or whatever, I just cant feel terrible for weeks on end, or I will fail."

However, I have an eating disorder. Trigger warning for anybody who may get hurt :( I have binge eating disorder and lately not only did I completely regain all of the weight, I am so scared to weigh myself because I wholeheartedly believe I now weigh more.

I started losing weight by my own good will (as previously my mother was forcing weightloss on me) at the age of 14 after my visit to the hospital when I was told I weighed 120 kilos and I had insulin resistance (pre-diabetes for diabetes type 2). Ever since then I dropped all the way to 79 kilogrammes and I was happier than ever. Of course, all of this happened for many years and only last year I nailed this goal. Sadly, I had some severe family disruptions and my BED has been triggered ever since.

I lost my way, so to say. I know the basics of calorie counting and I plan on again following a stricter regime. My question is: which are the MOST NUTRITIONALLY NEEDED foods? As a result of my binges consisting mainly of very sugary very carbohydrate-based meals I am experiencing vitamin deficiencies and at this point fresh fruit and vegetables are a must. I really want to cook for myself, too, since I finally left home. What are some recipes that I can follow which are low in calories? As I am a Slavic person our kitchen consists of mainly using potatoes and starchy foods, though there are some lovely recipes. I made lentils for the first time, too! It was delicious and I enjoyed it. Of course, I experimented with spinach and rice, though I suppose using brown rice would be a good idea?

I go to gym 5 days a week. 

Monday : Upper body biceps triceps + chest exercises.

Tuesday : rest

Wednesday : leg day

Thursday : back day

Friday : chest day

Saturday : Upper body biceps triceps 

Sunday : rest  


I swim pool or jogging for 30min - 1hour everyday and burn 500 calories. I also do 8 sets everyday of different types of push ups, i dont count reps i just do till failure.

For my diet right now :

In calories i eat a little surplus than my BMR of 1760, i eat 1900 calories a day, and everyday i do jogging or swimming pool to have a little deficit of around 360 - 400 deficit, i try to reach 2.2x gram per weight kilo of protein a day (i weight 68kg so 150g of protein).  


I do intermittent fasting from 6 - 7pm to 12am the next day

For the 12am meal (idk the word in english) i eat meal with a lot of protein, eggs, ham trenche with no fat, chicken, sardines, sometimes with a little cheese, 2 trenche of complete bread. I also like to eat a salad or a fruit if i dont feel full. Usually 500 - 600 calories

&amp;#x200B;

For the dinner i live at my parents house and for dinner we eat at 5pm, also some days in the week they like to eat junk food (usually 3 days), but the rest we eat, pasta, rice, vegetables. I always calculate the calories when we eat junk food and for me it is usually around 800 - 1000, 300 - 500 the healthy meal days.  


After dinner :  
If i ate junk food with a lot of protein (like burger or fried chicken) i eat a fruit, (usually a mango mixed) and black chocolate square to fill the 1900 calories only if they are not already filled, my protein objective is usually attained these days.

If i ate junk food with less protein (like pizza or nachos), i try to eat the least while still profiting these days, and ill just make myself a protein shake to reach my protein objective + a fruit if i still didn't reach 1900 calories yet.

I’ve been trying to hit 1200 a day. With as little fat (besides good fats), as possible. 

Today I woke up, had a like fibre bar and a coffee, went to a meeting.
Had a Pickle, Ham, Lettuce Baguette w/chilli sauce for lunch and a little drinkable cholesterol yoghurt.
Went to the gym for a couple hours, came back and made some Black Bean Spaghetti, haddock fillet and salad. 

But that’s only about 800 calories? Will I be okay, or do I need to force myself to eat another 200-400 calories in order to lose weight? It’s not worrying but 1200 worth of salad is a LOT. So I’m curious

0,"I don't remember ever having this reaction before, but over the last couple of days I noticed that I would feel unusually energized (almost to the point of giddiness) after eating organ meat.  Assuming this could be linked to a nutrient deficiency, what specific nutrient(s) might I be missing in my diet?

Considerations:

* I don't get the craving beforehand, only during and after eating organ meat.  I keep thinking about having more, and need to consciously stop myself from wolfing down an entire serving.  The cravings seem to be getting weaker over time though, as I've been consistently eating them recently.
* I take Vitamin D semi-regularly and never felt energized afterwards, so I don't think it's related to the change in season and amount of sunlight.
* I've been previously prescribed iron tablets for minor anemia, but since a couple years ago my doctor has indicated that I don't need to take them anymore.  While I've felt less tired after taking the tablets, I don't ever recall feeling the level of energy that I'm feeling now after eating organ meat just once or twice.  I also don't get the same energetic reaction after having spinach, fish, eggs, or even caffeine (though sometimes I do crave those foods).  Bloodwork doesn't show an iron deficiency?
* The one thing that has come remotely close to raised energy levels is Coenzyme Q-10 supplements, which are known to have this effect and I've only taken them twice before--I don't have a craving for any supplements.
* I've never had pica, I'm not pregnant, and I'm way past puberty.
* The specific organ meat is pork heart, which I've never had before.  There aren't any special occasions or memories associated with it, I just happened to try it one day.  I've had liver, but don't like the taste and never have a craving for it.
* There's nothing special about the taste or method of cooking, if anything it cooked and tasted like any other cut of pork meat/muscle (frankly, it's more a muscle than organ) so I don't think it's simply the novelty of it.  I don't have such strong cravings for any other cut of pork or meat.
* There hasn't been any change in my usual activity, stress, or hunger levels; I've had trouble sleeping, but this isn't anything new either.  I don't think it's really related to regulatory cycles as there hasn't been any drastic change in my daily schedule?

I've been trying to eat more healthy over the years to curb anxiety and low mood, so if I could pin down what it is that's helping me now then that could be a life-changer. ^(Or maybe my body just decided to randomly go through a vampire phase. /s)","Sudden craving, nutrient deficiency?","Sudden craving, nutrient deficiency?

7a - 60g protein shake with some added frozen banana/ strawberries 
730- fiber1 English muffin w a microwaved egg and slice of cheddar and a cpl cups of coffee w splenda and fat free creamer

I break up eating that to every cpl hours as small snacks. 
6-7 pm dinner and evening supplements. Basically the same as the morning on them. 
Dinner is a free for all with my wife making whatever she makes. I just always buy the leanest meat possible.

Why do people go for the traditional one?
Is it simply for the more raw taste of it
Or is there a nutritional benefit as well?

I am looking for participants who are over the age of 18, of any gender and background. This survey is open to everyone who pretty much eats food

0,"I am conflicted about intuitive eating. I am new to it. Doesn't it allow for over eating? If I eat whenever I am hungry I would always be eating. Also I think that people have different philosophies on why to eat healthy. Someone might want to eat better to feel good. Others want to get in shape. Intuitive eating seems to say that all bodies are good. Which I agree. But I have been overweight my entire life. I have never been on a plane or a Rollercoaster or a slide. My seat belt doesn't reach in my car. I'm tired of never fitting in things. Or getting winded from going up a flight of stairs or get sweaty from just sitting in my bed. 

I also think some people eat healthy for longevity. Like their only goal is to eat as healthy as possible as perfectly as possible. They say you can eat cake or chips and stuff like that once and a while and your health will still be fine. But you can still make the argument that on average a person who never eats sugar , candy, sweets, juice, soda, chips, and fast food will probably have at least slightly higher chances of living longer than someone who does eat those things even if the're eating them in moderation as part of a well rounded eating lifestyle(diet). Wouldn't eating a healthy diet mean eating as healthy as possible as often and as perfectly as possible? Isn't that the point?

Does anyone have an iron focussed diet plan they could share?

For a woman of childbearing age with heavy periods, so I need about twice as much iron as a man.

I had a deficiency and am determined not to get it again.

However the guidelines seem to indicate I need three big portions of meat per day! Seems like each dinner sized portion has about 6 mg iron and I need at least 18 mg per day.

I would find it difficult to eat that much of any food, especially meat. I don't want to take supplements, I want to do it naturally if possible.

I don't like eating meat excessively, losing appetite altogether and the only reason i can even have a certain amt of calories at this point is because of carbs whoch i need ti desperately cut cause of pcos. I also had covid for the last week and barely ate throughout as well.

For today so far I've eaten 1100 calories maybe and im overestimating. I've had 2 cups of rice, half a small potato and I've had a kfc twister (347 calories). 


I don't like eating meat excessively, losing appetite altogether and the only reason i can even have a certain amt of calories at this point is because of carbs whoch i need ti desperately cut cause of pcos. I also had covid for the last week and barely ate throughout as well. 

What alternatives can u guys suggest? Everyone keeps saying salads and fun recipes but they also cost money I dont want to spend. Ive realised i need routine and consistency with my diet otherwise i wont eat. 

Any advice is appreciated."

0,"[22 f] I can forget to have certain meals through the day and not really notice, or only notice hours later as I don’t feel particularly hungry (especially breakfast)

But it often takes a long time for me to feel full when eating. Sometimes I’ll eat a lot of food and then 10 minutes after finishing I’ll feel unbearably full, then be able to eat again in another 20 minutes. 

Because of this, some days I’ll have way less calories than I should, and others I have way way more (particularly snacks as I just keep going). 

I tried keto last year during lockdown as Im slightly overweight and struggle losing weight, maybe partially due to PCOS which it seemed to help. It also seemed to regulate my appetite. I was never unbearably full and I was always a nice level of hungry when it came close to meal times.

I'm on my first week of a 16:8 IF, basically 12noon - 8pm are the times I'd eat.

Diet: Typical asian, cutting out sugars from drinks though. I got skimmed milk and cereal and fruits for afternoon snacks.
During fasting, I only drink plain tea and espresso shots.

I do try to walk before and after the workday. I do about a 100 pushups and bodyweight squats a day. 5 sets of 20.

- There's a period after the hunger pangs where I'm no longer hungry. Is that when autophagy starts?
- How should I tide across these short depressive mood swings?

0,"Hi everyone. I'm an undergraduate psychology student examining the impact of diet type and generational cohort on meat eating justifications for my final year major research project. I particularly need more participants who have a flexitarian diet (i.e a mainly vegetarian diet with occasional meat eating), and those aged 42-57. I am aware that some people find the religious questions non applicable/not like them if they aren't religious.

0,"Hey guys. I started dieting last week. I am a 230 pound male and I’m 23. 

The best way for me to loose weight is to limit my calories to around 1000-1500 a day while also going to the gym a few times a week. 

It probably isn’t the healthiest thing but I am able to loose weight fast this way. 

I noticed that while I’m just sitting down my heart rate dips to 55-65.  And sleeping it can go 45-55. 

Before dieting I was around 70-80sitting down. 

Is this because of me consuming way less calories? Wondering if anyone has any idea or if they had a similar experience while cutting calories.

I knew I couldn't completely quit all the food that I've been eating my entire life cold turkey. Trying to change something completely in one day when you've been doing it your whole life is to me, impossible and a waste of time. Instead I had decided to think of a strategy and I was wondering if anyone could give me feedback on if its a good idea!

What I intend to do is still eat the food I normally do, but make minimal changes at the start of the transition. I would try to eat at least one type of fruit or vegetable at the end of the day. I'm doing that for a couple weeks to help me get used to fruits and veggies in my diet. It's worked in a sense as I feel a lot more comfortable now eating it at the end of the day! However the future is what I'm wondering about, perhaps I should do the same but just increase the amount of fruits and vegetables I eat.

2 scoops of protein powder a day, 15 egg whites, and 2-300 ish grams of protein usually lets me hit my goal. I have enough calories left over to get some veggies and carbs in too.

Is there anything wrong with this? Am I forgetting any nutrient I should be careful of? I appreciate any help thanks! :)

I was also wondering if 15 egg whites a day is too much?",Question regarding nutrition,"Question regarding nutrition I recently started working out very seriously. I decided might as well make sure my diet is up to par to see the best results possible!

I’m around 210 pounds @ 5”10, overweight but with a decent muscular build. (170 is a good target for me to be at a solid bf %). 

Right now I’m running a cut of 2100 cals @ 200g of protein per day. Making sure I’m getting a decent amount of carbs and fats in aswell, in addition to a 6 day/week ppl with 25 mins of low impact hiit.

In terms of my supplementation I take b complex, calcium, magnesium, 3000iu vitamin d, fibre, omega 3, and other multivitamins in addition to my diet.

I will try to keep it short and on point.

I am a woman. So I “naturally” fluctuating between nice skinny and skinny fat. Every attempt to gain weight or get fitter is counter productive.

Whenever I just eat more I get more out of shape than when I eat very little. My legs get SKINNIER when I eat! Yes skinnier. My belly gets fatter, but that wouldn’t be a problem if my legs were not getting skinnier at the same time. Basically when I eat more (on “balanced diet”) I look more insulin resistant. When I eat less I have a skinny hourglass figure. 

Out of desperation, this summer I did fruiterian with ocasional low fat vegan and I actually kept hour glass shape. Still skinny but high carb resulted in proportionate figure. Some bottom weight and flat stomach.

After 6 months now I introduced meat and my legs and my butt are getting skinnier. My belly is getting chubby and I look shapeless. 
Its very obvious that eating meat is making me more INSUIN RESISTANT I tried just meat with low carb and meat with balanced carb. Result is worse when I eat just meat, but close in both cases. (High quality carbs, no junk). In general I eat almost 0% junk and I prepare all my own food. 

My suspicion was: high fat induced insulin resistance from meat, but again ocasional vegan dish with oil didn’t previously have the same effect as meat. And I cook meat with no oil. 

Second idea is high uric acid form purines in meat? Uric acid can lead to insulin resistance. 

Please if you have any idea, god bless you! But please don’t tell me to work out, this is an attempt to hack my diet without combing any other factors. 

I tried adding more fiber/resistant starch to be the same level as when I was fruiterian/vegan no success.

0,"Title is an understatement, I am M(39) and a week ago I was 425 lbs. I've known for a very long time I needed some radical life changes, I don't want to get into that here.  After a year of researching, planning and just plain procrastinating, I went on a whole food vegan diet about a week ago.  

So far I have not had many problems with hunger or cravings, I did tell myself that if I was hungry, I would eat something, though it would only be unprocessed natural foods.  For example I was hungry last night so I had about a half cup of unsalted almonds.  All in all I have been pleasantly surprised how easy it has been so far. 

My diet consists of a chickpeas (hummus and other various forms), spinach, sweet potatoes, beets, edamame, black beans, quinoa, fruits such as bananas, strawberries, blueberries, clementines.  I also use peanut butter, almond butter with almond milk for smoothies. Other various nuts, legumes and seeds too.  Very little bread, wheat when I do. For dessert before bed I'll have a cup of coconut milk yogurt with about a half cup of thawed blueberries on occasion. This is not all inclusive and I will probably slowly branch out but you get the idea.

An example of a typical dinner, last night I made chana masala, one of my favorite indian dishes.  I had a cup of that with a cup of quinoa. 

It is a very restrictive diet, but again, I haven't had much problems with hunger or cravings.  I am aiming for about 1800 calories a day, but it probably sometimes creeps to 2000.

I expected to lose a lot of water weight at first, I lost about 10 lbs in 2 days. But from what I know this diet, about a 1000 calorie deficit from my BMR, should take off about 2 lbs a week, which is what I want.  However this is so far not what I'm seeing.  After the initial 10 lbs, I have consistently lost about 0.5 to 1 lb a day. I'm worried that could be problematic and unhealthy.  Should I just increase portion size?  Even if I'm full which I often am?  Or is this still just shedding water weight?

Another surprising thing, sorry kinda gross, I expected to be pooping more, but I'm actually pooping less, once a day.  I do not feel constipated at all, there just seems to not be a lot in there.

Also, there are tons of advice online on what supplements to take on this diet.  I started taking b12 and D3 supplements, I'm not sure if I need to add calcium, iron, and Omega3 to it.

1.5 scoop protein powder    45g protein 
170g Greek Yogurt                 16g protein

Then I usually go to school where I don’t eat anything 

Dinner (5/6/7pm)

170g (or more*) chicken breast               40g protein 
1/4th cup rice (dry) 
1tbsp grape seed oil 
170-200g broccoli/peas
28g shredded parmesan 
28g walnuts (just a snack in the evening)

Day total:

1400 cals, 132g* protein, 97g carb, 58g fat 


I’m an 18yo male, 178lbs 5’8 (overweight), around 25-30% body fat, and I am just starting this diet.  My estimated tdee while working out 3-5x a week is 2400. I genuinely think my macros are enough to build some strength while losing weight. Would this large calorie deficit harm me? lower metabolism or cannibalize muscle? 

I know the general trend is -500 from tdee for weight loss but is what i am doing extreme (-800/1000)?Macros seem good to me?

0,"TL;DR - Are there any articles linking first shift work to weight gain? There are plenty that link 3rd shift work to weight gain, but my personal experience has been polar opposite. I lose weight on 3rd shift and gain *massive* amounts on 1st shift. 



I am currently knocking on the door of morbidly obese. I'm 6'4 and topping the scales at an absolutely embarrassing and disgusting 280 pounds. I've developed weight induced sleep apnea, but I cannot use a CPAP. I've tried it and the damn thing leaves me choking at night. 




I have worked a variety of shifts over the years. In my 14 years of being full time in the work force, I have spent 10 of those years working night shift. Of my 10 years on night shift, 9 of those years were as a bus driver, in a very sedentary role. I worked 1st shift for the company one year, and 2nd shift for the company another year, for 11 years total (I quit mid year my final year). In my 11 years with the company, my body weight went from 180 at the start to 220 at the end. So all told I gained 40 pounds in 10 years. The majority of the weight gain occurred the years I worked 1st and 2nd shift.





I thought this was a coincidence, so when I left being a bus driver and became a mechanic, I got a job working for a small shop on 1st shift. I worked there 10 months from 2019 to 2020. In those 10 months I gained another 40 pounds ballooning up to 260 and starting to not fit in my work uniforms anymore.





I was forced out the door as a mechanic during Covid. I got a job working at a trucking company as a forklift driver and worked there for a year. Six months as a forklift driver, 6 months as a yard truck driver (jockey, hostler, etc). The six months I was a forklift driver, I worked a variety of second shift hours (4 pm to 2 am, 1 pm to 10 pm, etc). I noticed I started losing weight. I dropped about 10 pounds to 250 or so within the first couple months. Then I switched to yard hostler. This wasn't a hugely physical job, but there was some moderate walking. It was also 3rd shift. I came in at 830 pm and worked until 6 am 5 days a week. Between having coworkers who refused to help me and having to work these horrid hours, I decided to quit and go into IT, have an office job, 40 hour work weeks, etc. My last day as a hostler I weighed myself, and I was 235 pounds. That was mid August 2021. I have been working first shift now since September 2021 in a IT help desk role, and in 5 months I have gained *FIFTY* pounds. 






I look and feel horrible. I have knee, ankle, and hip pain from years of marching band which is being severely aggravated. I have neck pain, lower back pain, and my sleep apnea is getting worse (judging by how often I wake to pee and how I have a sore throat daily from snoring). 





My diet hasn't changed tremendously over the past 14 or so years. I eat the same foods. I have lost my sources of *any* type of physical activity however. Up until 2016 I was a pretty hard core line dancer. There was a bar locally that had dancing 4 nights a week, and depending on my work schedule I could make 2 or 4 nights. That bar closed in 2016 and there have been a few attempts to reopen a dance bar in town, but they have all mostly failed. My only options for line dancing are 60-100 miles away, not really doable on a regular basis. My other physical activity of choice was all-age drum and bugle corps (think competitive marching band for adults). I participated in various programs at various intensity levels from 2010-2019. I walked away from the activity after 2019 because I no longer found local ensembles that had the environment I was looking for. The closest competitive group that meets my interests is almost 1000 miles away. That is not at all doable when rehearsals are every weekend. 







I hate traditional exercise. Going to a gym, push ups, running. I hate it all. People get an endorphin rush, I just get a rush of depression and self hatred. One friend suggested I try and find a workout partner. I don't know how to do that, so that's out of the question.","Lots of articles about night shift weight gain, but none about day shift weight gain.","Lots of articles about night shift weight gain, but none about day shift weight gain. TL;DR - Are there any articles linking first shift work to weight gain? There are plenty that link 3rd shift work to weight gain, but my personal experience has been polar opposite. I lose weight on 3rd shift and gain *massive* amounts on 1st shift. 



I am currently knocking on the door of morbidly obese. I'm 6'4 and topping the scales at an absolutely embarrassing and disgusting 280 pounds. I've developed weight induced sleep apnea, but I cannot use a CPAP. I've tried it and the damn thing leaves me choking at night. 




I have worked a variety of shifts over the years. In my 14 years of being full time in the work force, I have spent 10 of those years working night shift. Of my 10 years on night shift, 9 of those years were as a bus driver, in a very sedentary role. I worked 1st shift for the company one year, and 2nd shift for the company another year, for 11 years total (I quit mid year my final year). In my 11 years with the company, my body weight went from 180 at the start to 220 at the end. So all told I gained 40 pounds in 10 years. The majority of the weight gain occurred the years I worked 1st and 2nd shift.





I thought this was a coincidence, so when I left being a bus driver and became a mechanic, I got a job working for a small shop on 1st shift. I worked there 10 months from 2019 to 2020. In those 10 months I gained another 40 pounds ballooning up to 260 and starting to not fit in my work uniforms anymore.





I was forced out the door as a mechanic during Covid. I got a job working at a trucking company as a forklift driver and worked there for a year. Six months as a forklift driver, 6 months as a yard truck driver (jockey, hostler, etc). The six months I was a forklift driver, I worked a variety of second shift hours (4 pm to 2 am, 1 pm to 10 pm, etc). I noticed I started losing weight. I dropped about 10 pounds to 250 or so within the first couple months. Then I switched to yard hostler. This wasn't a hugely physical job, but there was some moderate walking. It was also 3rd shift. I came in at 830 pm and worked until 6 am 5 days a week. Between having coworkers who refused to help me and having to work these horrid hours, I decided to quit and go into IT, have an office job, 40 hour work weeks, etc. My last day as a hostler I weighed myself, and I was 235 pounds.

I'm 26F, 5'3"" and I currently weigh about 135lbs (estimated body fat ratio of 30%). Pre-lockdown I weighed 110lbs and at peak fitness had an estimated body fat ratio of 18%. I loved my body then, and hate my body now, so I'm hoping to shed nearly 2 stone. 

Based on my height and lack of activity, to maintain my weight I'd need about 1300 calories a day. I've lowered my calorie intake to 900 a day now, with a macro split of 50% carbs, 20% protein and 30% fat. I want to increase my protein intake, but tend to struggle with it. 

Currently, I usually have a medium banana in the morning and a cup of cappuccino with oat milk (no sugar). Caffeine is my saviour, the coffee is the one thing that is a must in my diet. For lunch I have two boiled eggs and a nakd bar (probably the unhealthiest thing on my menu). For dinner I have Huel (the Hot &amp; Savoury variety), which is the bulk of my calories and fills me up so I don't stay awake in bed feeling hungry.

I really want to be serious and lose weight.

I am working 6 days, all day from 10-9pm. So I would like to add a bit of exercise to my routine but it’s going to be hard. I have an office job, so don’t get much exercise at all. 
I was wondering would it make a difference, if I do 15-30 mins everyday? Just like follow different YouTube videos?

As for my diet, I tend to skip breakfast, wait out til 4-5 pm to eat and just drink coffee and have a snack or two and three come home and have dinner. I know that needs to change. 

For starters, I know I must increase my water in take
My plan was to have some sort of protein for breakfast and a carb of choice (boiled eggs and bagel) as it’s quick and do easy

For lunch to have something similar (portion of rice, protein, and serving of vegetable) 

As for snacking, I’ll switch to having carrots, yogurt, apple sauce. Just something healthier and Not processed

Lastly for dinner, I was thinking to stick to light weight options, so maybe a salad or steamed veggies. 

Along with this, I was thinking to keep my calories at around 1400 a day.

**📷**Every day, people all over the world are struggling to lose weight and prevent obesity.Weight loss tips are the best way to slim down. Here are some of the most effective ones that you should know about. 

Tips for losing weight:

💟Stop eating before you're full, eat only until your body says it's full

Despite what dietitians, personal trainers and food manufacturers might say, our bodies are not actually ""full"" when we are satisfied. In fact, our stomachs can stretch to accommodate food up to 12-16 ounces.            [https://weightbroken.blogspot.com/2022/01/a-guide-to-weight-loss-tips-and-tricks.html](https://weightbroken.blogspot.com/2022/01/a-guide-to-weight-loss-tips-and-tricks.html)

💟Eat more vegetables and fruits

Organic produce is not only good for your body, it can also help your mind. Fruits and vegetables contain a variety of nutrients that help to boost brain health. As people age, their ability to digest food properly becomes more difficult which means that nearly all nutrients are lost if the food is not eaten raw. This can lead to serious problems such as headaches and dizziness. They can be prevented by eating a healthy breakfast.",A GUIDE TO WEIGHT LOSS TIPS AND TRICKS TO SLIM DOWN,"A GUIDE TO WEIGHT LOSS TIPS AND TRICKS TO SLIM DOWN

**Background** \- I started off at [30% BFP](https://imgur.com/a/RboS0Bf) in Nov 2021, and 31.7 KG SMM. Now, on Feb 1, I am [24% BFP](https://imgur.com/a/X9ADClk) and 35 KG SMM. (2.4% loss per month) (However, recently after plateauing, **I am losing 1.2% fat per week)**

I used to be at 15% bf and had about 3000 BMR before covid, then I went into depression due to lack of socialization and got to 33% bf and BMR of 1500

**Current Diet and Workout** \- I currently do a 2.5 hr workout 5/6 days a week, spending 1000ish kcal and eating 1700/1750 kcal with 165g protein, 40-50g fat and rest carbs. I also watch my vitamin intake and have done blood tests to confirm that I am not deficient in any vitamins or minerals.

**Problem** \- However, my BMR is still VERY low, 1697 kcal. How do I go about increasing my BMR?

I am going to uni in a month and would like to drink and eat like students do and not worry about my BMR.

**Ideal goal** \- Ideally I would love to be back at 17.5% bfp by end of Feb or Mid-march

Any feedback or questions are more than welcome!",Low BMR,"Low BMR

**Background** \- I started off at [30% BFP](https://imgur.com/a/RboS0Bf) in Nov 2021, and 31.7 KG SMM. Now, on Feb 1, I am [24% BFP](https://imgur.com/a/X9ADClk) and 35 KG SMM. (2.4% loss per month) (However, recently after plateauing, **I am losing 1.2% fat per week)**

I used to be at 15% bf and had about 3000 BMR before covid, then I went into depression due to lack of socialization and got to 33% bf and BMR of 1500

**Current Diet and Workout** \- I currently do a 2.5 hr workout 5/6 days a week, spending 1000ish kcal and eating 1700/1750 kcal with 165g protein, 40-50g fat and rest carbs. I also watch my vitamin intake and have done blood tests to confirm that I am not deficient in any vitamins or minerals.

**Problem** \- However, my BMR is still VERY low, 1697 kcal. How do I go about increasing my BMR?

I am going to uni in a month and would like to drink and eat like students do and not worry about my BMR.

**Ideal goal** \- Ideally I would love to be back at 17.5% bfp by end of Feb or Mid-march

So I started my cut on the first of January to hopefully look decent for this summer. This is something I’ve done the last few years since I started taking training seriously. But unlike my other cuts I’ve lost weight extremely fast.

I was bulking from June until December. I started my cut on the first of January and now one month later I’ve lost 10lbs. The only thing I’ve done is lower my calories. I don’t do any cardio. That’s something I implement later in my diet. I went from 3500 calories on my bulk to 2800 now on my cut. Should I raise my calories? Dieting at 3000 calories seems like a lot.

And is it also okay that I don't have a regular eating schedule since I have really random work/appointment schedules so it's hard to keep it all the same times everyday.",Eating 1 meal a day?,"Eating 1 meal a day? All my life I've skipped breakfast because it caused me stomach pain throughout the day if I didn't continuously eat ( and I mean every 30 minutes ) Not sure why but I left it at that.
Right now I'm skipping breakfast and also lunch (except when my coworker invites me to something on the occasion) and just eat when I get back from work.

0," So basically, I was thinking about doing a k-pop-esque diet this weekend since I am overweight irl. It will be a 3-day diet plan. For breakfast I will have Kang Sora's breakfast diet where I eat an apple and yogurt, for lunch I will have Suzy's lunch diet where I eat brown rice (or white rice if there is none) and a vegetable salad, and for dinner I will have IU's dinner diet where I drink a protein shake.

By the third day I will look skinner irl, people on the internet said that it would help me lose weight faster. Also, I would go workout during my diet. I hope I can get to have my dream body in 3 days as a result.

0,"Hi everyone!

My question is related to the title, but it has some other parts that I'll add onto here.

Essentially, I've been making a conscious decision to cut down on my calorie intake, especially in things that have become a habit for me. For example, cutting down to half a can of coke rather than a full one everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this, I'm not a big eater. I'll have anywhere between 1-2 meals a day, on some days I just don't. If I'm having 2 meals or more, I don't really mind counting calories because I will assume I've reached/exceeded my daily advised calorie intake (around 1700), but my norm is less than this. Significantly so if I'm just having a coffee or half a coke throughout the entire day. (Worth noting that this isn't me ""dieting"", my eating habits have always been like this.) 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this: Even though I'm consuming something high in calories like a coke, but I'm not really having anything that has significant calories throughout the day (so that by the end of the day my calorie intake is less then 800 at most), should I expect to see a change in my weight? Is this how calories work or am I just grievously misunderstanding the whole thing?

Due to covids consequences my taste and smell are completely broken for almost a year now. Almost everything makes me gag, barely able to tolerate some smells. I pretty much gave up hope on ever regaining it, dealing with lots of depressions etc.

Anyway long story short: I can only tolerate to eat Oatmeal as breakfast and for dinner pasta with mayonaise (zero) with tiny chunks of ham to add some texture. Anything meat related tastes horrible, hence only tiny pieces and a little bit. I am attempting to find more tolerable foods as I go about my life, but it is not an easy task. It kinda sucks buying and having to throw away food as you can imagine.

Can any experts tell me what this specific diet does to my body and how bad it could potentially be long term?

PS: If anyone beat the broken taste/smell from covid in the past, I would love to hear how you did it. I heard somewhere onions might help, but this happens to be one of the most horrible to my gag reflex.

The issue now is because it's low GI, I don't feel very full going to bed and it can take me a while to fall asleep.

Does anyone know if there's a way to cook a sort of mixed-GI meal? Like a risotto with a bunch of celery for low GI but then you put a small amount of high GI ingredients in to make you feel satiated enough to fall asleep?

0," TL;DR: what are your best health tips and what is the best way to continue learning about health, without drowning in content farms?

I'm interested in changing my diet (not that it's anything particularly bad right now) as I've been hearing/reading a lot about how consuming lots of grains (maybe I really only mean baked goods here) and sugar are detrimental to long term health. I know of a number of people who have converted to either Keto or a Carnivore diet, which I am considering. I also know a number of people who are vegetarian/vegan, and I'm not sure which is healthier (although presumably the latter is better for the environment). However, I've read papers talking about how glucose/fructose are large contributing factors for diabetes: I'm not sure about how much fruit I really ought to be consuming at all.

Generally, I'd like to drastically reduce my intake of sugar, processed foods (e.g. preservatives, artificially high sodium meals, etc.), and high fructose syrups, as clearly these are relatively new food groups with no established studies on the longer term health effects and I'd rather not run that experiment on my body.

Following a deeper rabbit hole, I know many people who say that the ""Gov Food Plate"" / food pyramid ideas are all pushed by ""Big Agriculture"", similar to how ethanol is mixed with gasoline at most gas stations. Or for instance, I frequently hear people in the US wonder how people in 3rd world countries survive without braces or wisdom teeth removal, but I believe it's been established that people in those countries don't have major teeth issues to begin with, as crooked teeth and painful wisdom teeth are symptoms of having a smaller jaw, which is believed to be caused by eating soft mushed food as children instead of having to chew and develop.

While I'm willing to read papers related to these issues, there are a few big issues I was hoping for tips on ameliorating, namely 1) having limited time to read 2) knowing who is reputable and who is not and 3) knowing what research is reputable (e.g. is a study with less than say 100 participants meaningful at all, and if they didn't use randomized control trials then are the results really objective?). And that's to say nothing of multiple studies having contradictory results.

0,"I was given a diet by a personal trainer that works super well for me. Basically it includes calorie counting (1800/day), no highly processed foods (white bread, fried food, simple sugars, etc), high protein, frequent cardio and lifting as well. I really enjoy this diet. I feel great, and I lose two pounds or slightly more each week. I would like to lose another 25 pounds or so to bring me closer to 15% body fat, while also maintaining as much muscle as possible.

Here is the thing: normal calorie counting with lifting and cardio also works for me without all the other food restrictions (the no white bread/fried food and whatnot). I still lose weight just counting 1800 calories a day. The reason I want to switch between the stricter diet and simple calorie counting is because it's gonna take me a while to lose these next 25 pounds, and I am getting a bit tired of the foods I'm allowed to eat. I'm a full time graduate student with a part time job, so cooking elaborate meals just isn't for me (I also use my uni's dining hall every day, and it is quite hard to adhere to the strict diet depending on the menu that day). I know the stricter diet is healthier overall but honestly I lose some motivation to continue when I am just so tired of eating the same foods. So I thought maybe for one week every month I will continue the calorie counting but allow myself to eat some other things.

My question is: Are there any consequences I should expect from something like this? Could it significantly stall my weight loss?

I'm a full time graduate student with a part time job, so cooking elaborate meals just isn't for me (I also use my uni's dining hall every day, and it is quite hard to adhere to the strict diet depending on the menu that day). I know the stricter diet is healthier overall but honestly I lose some motivation to continue when I am just so tired of eating the same foods. So I thought maybe for one week every month I will continue the calorie counting but allow myself to eat some other things.

My question is: Are there any consequences I should expect from something like this? Could it significantly stall my weight loss?

Tldr; thinking of occasionally switching from strict dieting to calorie counting just to be able to eat more foods I enjoy. Anything I should expect from this?"

I heard excessive egg white consumption can lead to biotin depletion, which in turn can hypothetically cause hair loss and trigger seizures. I eat three to four egg whites on a daily basis, and I have rather long hair with barely any symptoms of apparent hair loss but I'm still a little paranoid about it.

Are three egg whites a day alright? And if I wanted to regain the lost amount of biotin, what would be a healthy alternative to egg yolks, or should I just have an egg yolk a day?

0,"Hi, so I’m 5’2 weigh about 105-110 lbs. I’m not super pressed with losing weight I do want to get back into the gym but I’m a fairly fit-ish person. I used to struggle with an eating disorder and I can go for a while without eating but I’ve grown out of those thought patterns and I try to eat at least twice a day.

Breakfast - Greek yogurt or protein shake. Sometimes just a sweet latte.
Lunch - I work an intense job and some days don’t have time for lunch. The days that I do have time for lunch I eat between 11-1pm just depends when I don’t have a meeting. I get lunch at work so it’s usually either a salad from the salad bar (high protein I’m vegetarian) or some carb with a little protein (rice and lentils, noodles with tofu, whatever’s on the menu)
Dinner - If I didn’t eat lunch then I’m able to eat a small dinner and go to sleep feeling full. If I did eat lunch, then I’m way too full to eat anything for dinner, usually ends up being some crackers &amp; vegan queso or something like that

I’m definitely not eating as many calories as I should but I maintain my weight since I’m not working out either and I work a desk job. I’m trying to start working out but I work from 8am-6/7pm and then I get home, and I barely any time to myself before I have to take my melatonin, shower and sleep by 10. 

I would love to go home and eat dinner because what really gets me is that I’m so full from lunch I can’t eat dinner and then by like 9-10 I’m so hungry but also sleepy and it’s hard to sleep (I don’t take melatonin every night but I have SEVERE struggle sleeping and it helps me wake up early enough to go to work)

I’m not eating like huge portions or anything for lunch, sometimes maybe the salad if I put a lot of black beans or edamame but as a vegan protein is what keeps me full

However I currently would say I’m eating less than 1000 calories a day. Like 120-160 for breakfast, 300-500 for lunch if I eat lunch, and then probably 300-500 for dinner

Yesterday I forgot my yogurt and had no time for lunch so I got home and had a bean burrito and cheesy fiesta potato from Taco Bell for dinner around 8:40 (was exhausted after working 7-7, had to run errands, got home late) And then today I wasn’t hungry till 1pm so I had a salad (quinoa, corn, black beans, edamame, onions, carrots, a few sesame sticks, with a little dressing) and now I’m beyond full. I drink a lot of water through the day, no other drinks besides a kombucha 2x a week (my fav)

I’m just so full and will stay full and then I’m not gonna get hungry till late by which time I’ll be trying to sleep.

I am one of those people who puts on a lot of weight then I’m able to lose that weight pretty quickly. Not healthy but I’ve done this many times losing/gaining 60+ pounds. That is not my problem. The easy solution there is to maintain a healthy diet once I have lost weight. 

Why I am frustrated is I am not currently losing weight at the rate I have always lost in the past. My macros are all solid, under 1800 cal, low fat and carbs, high protein. I drink a barrel of  water daily and track everything that enters my mouth hole. I do cardio every other day and strength training every other day with the occasional day off.. I go very hard at the gym. I think I look like a crazy person when I’m on the elliptical because people stare at me with frightened looks as they walk by. 😂

Now I do have one of them fancy scales, and even though my weight loss has been minimal, my body fat has dropped 3% and my muscle mass has increased 3%.  Do these  cancel one another out indicating I am not losing weight? I am confused here, typically with my system I burn off 3-4 a week easily, I am going to week 4 with 4 lbs lost. I know that sounds ok but it’s way under my typical loss gains. My macros are configured for a 2.5 lb weekly loss and like I said with my regimen I typically get more.

I am aiming to be leaner and build muscle. I am in college so my restrictions are money and time.

For breakfast I eat either 2 protein bars (200 calories and 20 G protein each).

For lunch I eat 2 cans of tuna fish mixed with a small amount of light Mayo and a little spicy mustard.

For dinner I eat a rice bowl with one to two eggs, parsley, radish green onion, feta and sriracha. If I don’t eat this, I eat something similarly as light and protein-present.

When I’m hungry between meals, I snack on mixed nuts, cheese sticks or apples.

Is this a sustainable and good diet for what I want to accomplish?

Also, are there any tips on making cheap quick and nutritious college meals?

Has anyone tried this? How quickly/often did you start eating meat again, and what would be a good 'introduction' meat? I was thinking fish since it's really healthy from what I hear but I'm not sure. I'm a busy person so I don't want to have a funny stomach. I'm interested to hear any experiences or advice.

0,"Aajonus Vonderplanitz, nutritionist of the Primal Diet has a few protocols that he gives his clients for weight loss. One protocol, which can be applied raw or cooked, I will explain here.

He has his clients drink vegetable juice, and raw eggs. Thats it. Until you lose the weight. The vegetable juice had electrolytes, and will keep your digestion functioning well. The eggs, containing every nutrient in existence, are the easiest to digest food. They fully digest in about 30 minutes. The protein contains all the amino acids, and combined with good raw animal fat, the eggs provide great focus and energy. This also gives the intestines a great break because the egg completely digests at the very beginning of the intestines. 

But, I mean, you could eat hard boiled eggs and drink cucumber juice. You won’t get the benefit of giving the intestines a break. You’ll feel more shitty. Less energy. But you could do it. If you are scared of salmonella or something. 

I’ve never gotten sick off a raw egg. I’ve never met someone in real life who has gotten sick off of a raw egg. Good quality raw eggs though! Straight from the farm, or at least pasture raised. And don’t refrigerate it! You want the bacteria! It helps digestion! Or cook it. Don’t ban me. 

So for making the cucumber juice, a masticating juicer is best. If it is centrifugal, air will stir inside it and damage a lot of the nutrients. Better than no juice though. But you need to make it yourself, with organic cucumbers, and peel them! Very important to peel them. A lot have petroleum wax on them that is toxic. You could dice it, then blend it, then squeeze it through a strainer. You'll probably drink 1-3 cups a day. But a masticating juicer is best. You’ll get a better yield, and a higher quality juice.

Why juice? The fiber overly alkalizes the digestive tract, which prevents the digestion of the raw protein in the egg. It is very hydrating, and you’ll be more hydrated, with less liquids overall.

If you want to drink water, drink naturally carbonated sparkling water. Pellegrino is a brand I trust. Not sponsored. With carbonated water, the carbonation kills any bacteria, so it passes inspections to be sold with no chemicals . Other brands need some chemicals to deem it safe to pass inspection. Naturally carbonated mineral water is the best.

You could squeeze lemon or lime into the water for electrolytes for better hydration. 

Adding raw honey is great. Many brands that say raw, are heated often up to 160, degrees. It has to never go above 93. A majority of the time I get straight from the farmer, it is also heated. How you can tell is, eat it by itself, and if it burns your throat, it has been heated too hot at some point. The only 2 brands of honey I trust are called Really Raw which is in many health food stores, and Y.S. ORGANIC BEE FARMS. USDA ORGANIC 100% CERTIFIED ORGANIC RAW HONEY from Whole Foods in north west Arkansas.. Be really careful with your honey choice. Often, you need to take a picture of all the info of the honey at the store, and go home and email and call all of them and ask about the temperatures, heating, and storing during transportation, etc.

But honey is great. Don’t over do it though. Like 2 tablespoons per 4 ounces of water, with 4 ounces of lime or lemon juice. That is a good sports drink. You could even get raw cream, and crack a raw egg in it. The raw cream will prevent the egg from oxidizing, and provide raw fat, and the egg will give easily digested protein, for focus during whatever you are doing.

I could go into a lot more detail. I think it would have to be for other posts.

In the end:
1-3 cups of vegetable juice
.5-3 cups of mineral water with lemon/lime + honey.
12-60+ up to infinite raw eggs. You can eat as many raw eggs as you want.

Cucumbers must be organic and peeled.

Lemons/limes organic. Hand squeezed, strain seeds

Section for water from We Want to Live, Page 180 
“CARBONATED BEVERAGES AND WATERS: If a label reads “carbonation added” or “carbonated” it means that the carbonation is synthetic. Synthetic carbonation causes radicals and free radicals, resulting in mineral and oxygen deficiencies, sometimes resulting in headaches. If a label reads “naturally carbonated”, or “natural carbonation added” or “naturally sparkling”, the carbonation is natural from the well and highly charged with healthful electrolytes. See page 72.
In combination with unheated honey, naturally carbonated waters relieve most headaches. Naturally carbonated waters help relax adrenal glands. Therefore, if you are an individual with low energy, it would probably be better to drink naturally sparkling water only when needed in a remedy.”
So if you have low energy, don’t drink the carbonation. Just shake the carbonation out.
 
So with the eggs, you can eat as many as you want. If you ever get nauseous, that might be because your body is burning fat that has toxins in it and the toxins are being sent to the stomach to be neutralized by the hydrochloric acid. Don’t blame the eggs. Or the chickens are fed toxic feed with stuff like gmo corn, or soy. Chickens are scavengers, aka meat eaterns. A vegetarian diet is the worst diet a chicken could have. Make sure it is at least pasture raised. If an egg made you nauseous, maybe the egg is low quality. To combat that, if you eat the egg with a small bit of raw, unheated, unsalted cheese, the cheese will absorb anything toxic in the egg and prevent any damage. The egg is not the problem. Its the toxic feed, hormones, anything like that, that is given to the chickens. If the chicken is healthy, outside, no medicine, on healthy soil, fed no supplements, just extra bugs, or meat/organ scraps of other butchered animals on the farm. Or kill the predators and feed them to the chickens. That will make them healthy. No medicine. Just food, healthy soil, sunshine, healthy air.

Cheese also absorbs toxins that create nausea. Sometimes your body will break down toxins stored somewhere, and your body decides to send it to the stomach, to be neutralized by the hydrochloric acid to become less toxic, or if its severe, you will vomit those toxins out. Vomit is the strongest form of detox. The bacteria isn’t the problem. It will break down the toxins that are stored in the body from a lofe time of cooked food, and industrial toxins, from all sorts of things.

Whenever you need focus, just eat an egg. In about 15 minutes, you’ll start to get more energy.

This information is not a guideline to follow ir, it is just an example of what some of it would maybe look like. If you want to do it, don’t base it off of this information. Study Aajonus yourself, and do it right. Any problems that people have are always due to lack of understanding, or lack of access to the right foods. There is hundreds of hours of detailed information. There is a lot of condensed information also. But read both of his books. We Want to Live and The Recipe to Living Without Disease, in order to understand how to do it properly. Then you can get the details quoted from Aajonus himself from the help of a telegram group or another subreddit. There is a lot of information. But there are easy simple ways to start.

I would expect 1 lb lost a day, maybe up to 3, depends. If you feel too bad, or detox too hard, you need to eat the raw unsalted cheese, butter, more eggs, cut back on the vegetable juice and water, sip up to a gallon of milk a day

It is very important that you sip all liquids! If you don’t sip, you will piss out most of the nutrients. Your stomach breaks down your food, so that your intestines can digest it. If you chug anything, your intestines cant digest a lot of liquid at one time, because if it tried to, it would turn into a bunch of diarrhea. So a good rule of thumb that Aajonus recommends is about 1 oz per minute max. Or else you’ll piss it out and waste nutrients. 

Everything is better in glass. Anything that ferments in plastic will become toxic. The fermentation is a result of bacteria pre digesting the food. When it ferments in plastic, the bacteria also predigest the plastic, then the food becomes toxic. If its fresh in plastic, usually fine. Plastic wrap has a toxic chemical in it. Even when its in meat packaging. Meat touching paper is also bad. It won’t kill you though. Don’t let it sit for long! Transfer to glass. Same with milk. Transfer milk to glass. Cheese, butter, cream, honey, etc. 

Plastic is ok if its fresh and not too hot or cold. And doesn’t sit for very long. Won’t kill you if you break some of these rules. Some are more dangerous than others.

Can be done safe! The problems isn’t the food. Its the additives, packaging, heating, freezing. Keep your eggs room temperature!

Study Aajonus and base it all of him! Everything I said is based off of Aajonus. 

So how does the weight loss work? If you only eat eggs, you lose a lot of weight. That's what Aajonus says. It is true. Only eat eggs, you’ll lose a bunch of weight. And you drink the cucumber/celery juice when your thirsty, it will also keep your appetite high to eat more eggs. Aajonus recommends to eat a golfball size piece of raw beef whenever you are very hungry, but not angry-hungry. You can just do eggs though. If you aren’t into that, do the same thing , but with hard boiled eggs. But you’ll have more problems If you use pasteurized juice, you’ll have more problems. If you do fruit juice, even if raw, you’ll have more problems and be very emotional.

You really need to study a lot. The diet isn’t what's dangerous . This is just reality. He didn’t make food this way. It’s just how it is. You just have to change your understanding. To people who study diligently, it's all natural.

With carbonated water, the carbonation kills any bacteria, so it passes inspections to be sold with no chemicals . Other brands need some chemicals to deem it safe to pass inspection. Naturally carbonated mineral water is the best.

You could squeeze lemon or lime into the water for electrolytes for better hydration. 

Adding raw honey is great. Many brands that say raw, are heated often up to 160, degrees. It has to never go above 93. A majority of the time I get straight from the farmer, it is also heated. How you can tell is, eat it by itself, and if it burns your throat, it has been heated too hot at some point. The only 2 brands of honey I trust are called Really Raw which is in many health food stores, and Y.S. ORGANIC BEE FARMS. USDA ORGANIC 100% CERTIFIED ORGANIC RAW HONEY from Whole Foods in north west Arkansas.. Be really careful with your honey choice. Often, you need to take a picture of all the info of the honey at the store, and go home and email and call all of them and ask about the temperatures, heating, and storing during transportation, etc.

But honey is great. Don’t over do it though. Like 2 tablespoons per 4 ounces of water, with 4 ounces of lime or lemon juice. That is a good sports drink. You could even get raw cream, and crack a raw egg in it. The raw cream will prevent the egg from oxidizing, and provide raw fat, and the egg will give easily digested protein, for focus during whatever you are doing.

I could go into a lot more detail. I think it would have to be for other posts.

In the end:
1-3 cups of vegetable juice
.5-3 cups of mineral water with lemon/lime + honey.
12-60+ up to infinite raw eggs. You can eat as many raw eggs as you want.

Cucumbers must be organic and peeled.

Lemons/limes organic. Hand squeezed, strain seeds

Section for water from We Want to Live, Page 180 
“CARBONATED BEVERAGES AND WATERS: If a label reads “carbonation added” or “carbonated” it means that the carbonation is synthetic. Synthetic carbonation causes radicals and free radicals, resulting in mineral and oxygen deficiencies, sometimes resulting in headaches. If a label reads “naturally carbonated”, or “natural carbonation added” or “naturally sparkling”, the carbonation is natural from the well and highly charged with healthful electrolytes. See page 72.
In combination with unheated honey, naturally carbonated waters relieve most headaches. Naturally carbonated waters help relax adrenal glands. Therefore, if you are an individual with low energy, it would probably be better to drink naturally sparkling water only when needed in a remedy.”
So if you have low energy, don’t drink the carbonation. Just shake the carbonation out.
 
So with the eggs, you can eat as many as you want. If you ever get nauseous, that might be because your body is burning fat that has toxins in it and the toxins are being sent to the stomach to be neutralized by the hydrochloric acid. Don’t blame the eggs. Or the chickens are fed toxic feed with stuff like gmo corn, or soy. Chickens are scavengers, aka meat eaterns. A vegetarian diet is the worst diet a chicken could have. Make sure it is at least pasture raised. If an egg made you nauseous, maybe the egg is low quality. To combat that, if you eat the egg with a small bit of raw, unheated, unsalted cheese, the cheese will absorb anything toxic in the egg and prevent any damage. The egg is not the problem. Its the toxic feed, hormones, anything like that, that is given to the chickens. If the chicken is healthy, outside, no medicine, on healthy soil, fed no supplements, just extra bugs, or meat/organ scraps of other butchered animals on the farm. Or kill the predators and feed them to the chickens. That will make them healthy. No medicine. Just food, healthy soil, sunshine, healthy air.

Cheese also absorbs toxins that create nausea. Sometimes your body will break down toxins stored somewhere, and your body decides to send it to the stomach, to be neutralized by the hydrochloric acid to become less toxic, or if its severe, you will vomit those toxins out. Vomit is the strongest form of detox. The bacteria isn’t the problem. It will break down the toxins that are stored in the body from a lofe time of cooked food, and industrial toxins, from all sorts of things.

Whenever you need focus, just eat an egg. In about 15 minutes, you’ll start to get more energy.

This information is not a guideline to follow ir, it is just an example of what some of it would maybe look like. If you want to do it, don’t base it off of this information. Study Aajonus yourself, and do it right. Any problems that people have are always due to lack of understanding, or lack of access to the right foods. There is hundreds of hours of detailed information. There is a lot of condensed information also. But read both of his books. We Want to Live and The Recipe to Living Without Disease, in order to understand how to do it properly. Then you can get the details quoted from Aajonus himself from the help of a telegram group or another subreddit. There is a lot of information. But there are easy simple ways to start.

I would expect 1 lb lost a day, maybe up to 3, depends. If you feel too bad, or detox too hard, you need to eat the raw unsalted cheese, butter, more eggs, cut back on the vegetable juice and water, sip up to a gallon of milk a day

It is very important that you sip all liquids! If you don’t sip, you will piss out most of the nutrients. Your stomach breaks down your food, so that your intestines can digest it. If you chug anything, your intestines cant digest a lot of liquid at one time, because if it tried to, it would turn into a bunch of diarrhea. So a good rule of thumb that Aajonus recommends is about 1 oz per minute max. Or else you’ll piss it out and waste nutrients. 

Everything is better in glass. Anything that ferments in plastic will become toxic. The fermentation is a result of bacteria pre digesting the food. When it ferments in plastic, the bacteria also predigest the plastic, then the food becomes toxic. If its fresh in plastic, usually fine. Plastic wrap has a toxic chemical in it. Even when its in meat packaging. Meat touching paper is also bad. It won’t kill you though. Don’t let it sit for long! Transfer to glass. Same with milk. Transfer milk to glass. Cheese, butter, cream, honey, etc. 

Plastic is ok if its fresh and not too hot or cold. And doesn’t sit for very long. Won’t kill you if you break some of these rules. Some are more dangerous than others.

Can be done safe! The problems isn’t the food. Its the additives, packaging, heating, freezing. Keep your eggs room temperature!

Study Aajonus and base it all of him! Everything I said is based off of Aajonus. 

So how does the weight loss work? If you only eat eggs, you lose a lot of weight. That's what Aajonus says. It is true. Only eat eggs, you’ll lose a bunch of weight. And you drink the cucumber/celery juice when your thirsty, it will also keep your appetite high to eat more eggs. Aajonus recommends to eat a golfball size piece of raw beef whenever you are very hungry, but not angry-hungry. You can just do eggs though. If you aren’t into that, do the same thing , but with hard boiled eggs. But you’ll have more problems If you use pasteurized juice, you’ll have more problems. If you do fruit juice, even if raw, you’ll have more problems and be very emotional.

You really need to study a lot. The diet isn’t what's dangerous . This is just reality. He didn’t make food this way. It’s just how it is. You just have to change your understanding. To people who study diligently, it's all natural.

I usually have one fruit as a late night snack but I was wondering should I not since I ate fruit already today?"

0,"Hello everyone,   
I eat a quite unhealthy (sugary, wheaty, fast foody) diet and want to change. 

However, keto is just too hardcore for me. I just cannot eat that much protein overkill (is it even healthy, like 12 eggs in 1 meal for 1 person? I found such a recipe) and also I don't feel healthy eating loads of greasy bacon etc.

So I'm looking for a carb-reduced diet with a lot of greens and veggies, some fish/nuts/eggs/steak (in moderation), but also some ""healthy"" carbs like whole-grain foods. I want to cut out refined wheat altogether and significantly reduce my bread and pasta consumption, however not renounce them completely, just eat them less often than daily (maybe 2-3 times a week).

So all I see online on amazon etc. is those keto-books and low carb-books which practically are also keto-books in disguise. Is there a good book or diet which doesn't toss (wholegrain) carbs, but just reduces them to a more healthy amount?

0,"Hello everyone, I wanted to share with you my experience in losing weight healthily &amp; properly through a healthy meal plan diet.

A year ago I almost weighted 230 pounds and I tried some smoothies and other odd diet plan, however, they didn't work that well, so I was depressed and barely getting in my clothes that never fit me that well especially I am 24 years which is not old.

And people at such age can't weight that much at all because they always focus on having a comfortable life through having a good time, working out easily with no issues, (not feel ashamed when going out with friends) due to the unpleasant body shape and etc...

So, I tried a powerful and worthy diet plan called Keto Recipes and I honestly would give a huge hug to whoever created such incredible diet plan idea that changed my life from head to toe in almost months only. 

Keto Recipes is a healthy delicious meal plans that you will love eating everyday which will help you to lose weight in at least a month and get your desired weight in 2 months (you might take more based on how much you weight and are willing to lose) because I personally lost almost 18 pounds in one month only, and lost 15 more pounds in 23 days, and 17 pounds in another 30 days, so I totally lost 50 pounds in almost 3 month ONLY which is beyond my expectation because I thought I am going to take more than this.

But please stop believing whoever tells you you can lose 60 pounds in one month, because that's not possible and might be through an unsafety method, roughly you can lose between 15 to 20 pounds in one month as long as you want to do it healthily &amp; the right way with no problems because you need to slow down, don't be in a rush.

**From now guys please stop watching thousands videos about how can you lose weight and you end up with either wasting time or money or both. Time to get into the right Recipes plan and learn how to lose fat easily and healthily step by step.**

I have no problem eating that much food but my concern is that no matter how I play around with my diet I always end up getting over 200g of protein a day.

I am experiencing no complications and I feel perfectly fine, I also have no existing kidney conditions or other underlying health conditions.

I’m just wondering if 200g+ is okay, and if not what can I do to change it? Replace protein with fat? Carbs? Sugar?I’m open to anything

I have been able to lose the weight by consuming fewer calories, but I'm getting to the point where it isn't comfortable anymore.

0,"3 years ago I made a new years resolution to lose 30 pounds by next year. I kept track of what I did and this has been the only way that really worked for me. I have enough other stuff going on in my life to not try fad diets and when I did try keto I lost weight quickly but it came right back. 

I'm going to break this down into steps with what my weight was. M27(at the time) 5'11""

187: download my fitness pal and just track how much I eat ignoring what it said I should eat based on my weight. I did this for two weeks and I lost 4 pounds of holiday cheer. I weighed myself at the beginning and the end of this period and like twice in the middle. I also started taking a multivitamin and that helped me feel better in the mornings if nothing else. 

183: determine the average number of calories I was eating without even trying to diet and reduce that by 300 and started weighing myself every day. I also cut out soda and beer. Cutting out those empty calories wasn't even hard because I replaced them with actual food. I did have to supplement soda for diet soda for a little while W/E. I did this for about a month and lost 7 more pounds.

176: now it's mid March, I've lost 11 pounds, and I'm feeling pretty good about myself and April is around the corner. I sign up for a 5k in June and start by walking or using the elliptical in my apartment's gym 20 minutes every other day. Just the increase in physical activity and tracking what I was eating definitely helped me make healthier choices. I'm not wasting 800 of my daily 2100 calories on McDonald's.

165: it's now May. I haven't been fasting or anything and now instead of walking I'm able to run for about 30 minutes 4 days a week. I jog/walk the 5k in 42 minutes. I'm just happy to be outside but now I'm determined to do better. So I sign up for another one in July. 

157: I hit my goal sometime in July and my 5k time tracked via Strada was under 30 minutes so I was pretty pumped about that. My actual 5k time was just over 30 minutes. 

160: I stopped keeping track of my calories and I actually bounced back some after the 5K in July but that was ok because I was in much better shape. 

163: in August I realized not tracking calories and having beers with friends wasn't working so I went back to tracking calories and this time used the my fitness pal recommended 2200 calories to lose 5 pounds by the end of September. 

157 again: by October I was back to my goal weight and still track the calories to this day. I gained a little during the Wuhan flu lockdowns like everyone did since I couldn't work out  and I have now lost it. I was never as fat as before. 

What I learned from this experience is that tracking calories does work and you need to stay on top of it. I also learned that once you lose the first few pounds by easing into it you feel a lot better and you don't have to do anything extreme to get there. Finally doing that 5k really helped and I will recommend signing up for one to anyone who's trying to lose weight.

0,"So, I have been on a weight loss journey for a while now and really have not learned that much :(. I have lost weight rapidly and have been excessively tired (eating around 2600 calories with one 3150 day a week) then going to about 3100 calories and would loose 2 pounds in two days then somehow on day 3 gain back 2. I have went back to the 2600 calories recently my weight did something weird again.. (193.8, 193.4,192.2,192,190,191.2,192.8, 191.2,191.2,192.4). From 190-191.2, I went out drink with my friends an came back and honestly ate around 3800 calories that night due to the fact we got a couple of free pizza (yes I am still in college). Sunday came around, I stuck to 2600 and gained again!. Kept doing this and hit stagnant and so I decided I would guess around my maintenance (3200) and then gained back a pound today which I am guessing is water weight.

With all of this information, this has been happening for at least 4 months now and I cannot seem crack the code. I want to know my maintenance but do not want to but in the time to figure it out then when I loose weight have to redo it (slowly increasing and decreasing calories until I stop loosing weight; planning on doing this once I reach my goal). 

Another problem I am having is I am 5""11"" 192.2 as of today but have always (even since I was young) have eaten a lot of food. I always have sat around 14-20% (I know this is a big range but you can get the picture) but have built a lot of muscle over the years. 

I would love suggestions on how the heck I can crack the code, develop a good relationship with food (because I have hated it recently because of problems), and be able to loose weight at a good pace and still be happy with my life! I should also mention, the past couple months I ranged from 192-195 and got to the strongest I have ever been during this period. Not really any muscle loss.

But I am not sure if this is too low so I am still experimenting and it is not a standard because I do change my intake from time to time and I use intuitive eating to help listen to my body when needed.

But I think that the extra physical exercise from the bike is the major factor that I think is affecting everything else, including my psychological and physical ability to recover and stay focused during the day and while exercising.

I am experimenting with different things like increasing my sugar intake via fruits or sometimes sweets for instant sugar absorption (which may explain why I was craving a lot of things like sweets for some time), and I am drinking cranberry juice as according to my research, it helps boost recovery but I also learned that it is high fructose which is not easily absorbed and converted into glycogen.

I eat a lot of food. At least 3,000 calories a day.

However, I am constantly judged for how much food I eat by my family. Whenever I go home, the little comments about how much I am eating really distress me and negatively effect my relationship with food.

I try to remind myself that I exercise a lot more then my family, eat healthier lower calorie food, and I don't drink (most of my family probably drinks 500 calories of alcohol a day). However, hearing the comments repeatedly can start to mess with my head.

Do you have tips for dealing with these comments and negative feelings toward food when going home?"

0,"I'm curious; is there any difference to the benefits of water consumption based on how it's staggered throughout the day? 

I am trying (and so far succeeding mostly!) to get 100 oz of water consumed in a day. The problem is, I have to pee constantly when I do. I have found that it's more advantageous if I can front load my consumption to get as much as possible in before Noon, and then sparingly throughout the rest of the day. 

I haven't noticed any problems with this (no bloat or 'water logging' or anything like that) which is great, but i'm wondering if I'm losing out on the benefits of hydration by front-loading it like this? 

The way it usually shakes out is about 80-90 oz before Noon, with another maybe 20 or 30 scattered from Noon until 9pm.

0,"I don't know if this type of post is allowed here, so my apologies in advance. 

For the past year or so I have been having some GI issues that my doctor thinks might be EoE, and right now I am on a super restricted diet - not at the direction of my doc, but simply because I have felt better after eliminating many things (previous to all of this I had a very diverse diet). All of the eliminations occurred progressively over the span of a year until about 6 months ago when I didn't have to eliminate anything else because my symptoms had pretty much dissipated. So now, at this point, I've pretty much been eating the same small list of things for the past 6 months (aside from a few failed reintroductions) and I was just wondering if this current diet is providing me with enough vitamins/nutrients. See meals listed below.

Breakfast:

* Gluten free bread, toasted, with Nuttzo keto nut butter 
* So Delicious dairy free coconut yogurt, unsweetened plain
* 1 small-medium sized apple

Lunch:

* Sandwich (either tuna, sliced baked turkey loin, or ground turkey patty/burger) with Primal Kitchen Vegan Mayo, and mixed lettuce greens
* Grapes

Dinner: 

* Mixed lettuce greens with either tuna salad, baked turkey, or ground turkey patty/burger (I alternate with whatever I didn't already have for lunch)
* Quinoa (white or multicolored) with pumpkin seeds sprinkled on top 

Bedtime Snack:

* Same as breakfast (toast, nut butter, yogurt, apple)

Other Snacks:

* Any combination of the stuff I already eat (small piece of toast with nut butter; OR small apple and yogurt; OR some leftover turkey; etc)

I know this is a VERY limited diet and I'm not looking for any recommendations on how to diversify it at the moment - I'm just curious again as to if this diet is providing me with enough nutrition, and/or if there's a possibility I might not be getting adequate intake of a certain vitamin/nutrient. I currently don't take any other supplements (I was supplementing with D3 for years but had to stop \~4-5 months ago because I started having a reaction to it). I am also not on any medications.

Does anyone have any dietary advice that I could follow that will keep me energized all day? I can eat meals I bring from home during all my breaks.

I'm pretty sure I was ""bloated."" and I was a farting machine. thank god I work from home, but also, I was afraid to step outside. I had to look out my window to see if anyone was around before sprinting to the mailbox farting with each step. after 1 week lost 0lbs btw.

that had to stop and on to diet 2 (this takes me to last week). vegan diet. instead of restricting calories I engorged myself on bananas, potatoes, and various berries mostly. and kale. I'm not someone who is effected by food, but my first diet effected me and the second was even worse. I'm pretty sure I was ""bloated."" and I was a farting machine. thank god I work from home, but also, I was afraid to step outside. I had to look out my window to see if anyone was around before sprinting to the mailbox farting with each step. after 1 week lost 0lbs btw.

so last night, 40 days into dieting I reached my boiling point and binged. I partied with little Debbie. whatever. I literally had nothing to gain back. but onto phase 2. I watched a documentary on keto and I think this will be my third and final act. after engorging on ding dongs and birthday cupcakes (umm.. and Reece's and snickers and devil dogs and Oreos. oops) I passed out. the documentary ""fat fiction"" was saying how carbs make you crash (and much more.... it's an anti-carb documentary) so I thought hey I think they're right maybe I'll follow what they say. I ate a keto dinner tonight and honestly it was like heaven after doing vegan for a week."

I've put myself in a position where food is less convenient and I cut out a lot of unhealthy junk food. This has pretty much resulted in my cravings pretty much vanishing or becoming pretty easy to manage. It also helped to get on adhd meds. Making me far less impulsive and it admittedly makes my appetite more manageable.

Now there is this approach saying that you can only take so much calories per meal to not gain weight.

0,"I am male, early twenties, 177 cm (5'10) and weigh 80KG right now (176 lbs).  


I started dieting strictly around a month ago - 88KG ( 194 lbs) was my initial weight. According to BMI that was way too much (BMI was around 26 and should be around 18-22 at my age) - not only BMI but my body and foremost my face were just awful / are.  


I am very much aware about nutrition, it's a topic I have always been confronted with my whole life, I am a whole book about nutrition, don't worry about that. What's good, what's bad, what's needed and all that stuff.  


So in less than a month I lost around 8 KG, however I'd say it's realistically 6-7 KG as a bit of the initial weight loss must be water loss or just the quick reaction of my strict change to a strict diet while eating pizza and soda the day before. My goal is 63-68KG as this is the perfect weight I see for myself.   


Now let's get to the serious part. I know about jojo-effect, I know about malnutrition and all that stuff, but this is what I eat daily:  


I drink 3-4 liters of water a day, however I also pee like 5-8 times a day. Almost every day looks like that:  


Fish that makes up 300 calories, salad with tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, a diet salad sauce and my daily snacks inbetween are turkey breast stripes. I accurately measured every single ingredient, sauce and thing I eat daily for my own curiousity and I couldn't believe it when I found out my daily caloric intake is 650 calories, while my daily caloric intake for body weight maintenance would be around 2750 calories.  


The thing is, in 3 weeks I can start training at  the gym again, right now I'm doing HIIT training for 25 minutes 4-5 times a week, besides that I don't do much, I work home office and casually go out with my friends when doing stuff, mostly by car.  


I feel absolutely good, I don't feel more tired than before, i feel like I got more power than before my diet (maybe placebo because I start feeling better about the daily weight loss I see on my scale?).  


My goal is to start eating more calories once I can go to the gym again, hopefully in 3 weeks I will be at &gt;75KG body weight as then I would increase my caloric intake to 1000-1300 and therefore try to convert everything to muscle.  


I don't mind losing a lot of muscle right now as I prefer becoming very lean and thin first and then train like a beast and get into form, rather than being chubby and transform that to muscle. I mostly do it for the girls.  


So my question finally: IS THAT HEALTHY? I don't feel bad, I feel good, I know about jojo-effect and all that stuff, I have an exact plan of how I am doing all of that, I eat very healthy as I am only eating fish, water and vegetables. No sugar, no fast food, no candy, chocolate or anything, I don't even salt stuff.  


Whenever I go to threads and forums I see people getting absolutely smashed for eating 1000 calories a day because everyone says that's way too less and very unhealthy. And now I am sitting here with 650 calories a day, as a male.  


What is your opinion? Can you help me please, tell me what you think of it? Keep in mind that I have been doing this for almost a month now and feel very good, I can also see results already mainly on my belly, my biggest concern is my chubby face that I hope looks more defined at 68KG. At my rate I have a caloric deficit of almost more than 2000 calories a day. If 8000 calories make a KG, then that means I would be losing 1 KG every 4 days, which would mean 5-7 KG by the end of January.

Pellegrino I can vouche is safe. You also don’t need to drink as much water as you think. Ask some old grandparents how much they drank as a kid. Theyd take a few sips here and there at the fountain at school, and drink milk or soda at home. Doctors were payed only recently to say you need a ton of water, in order to make money selling water. People drink way too much and it actually dries their systems because water works as a solvent. To hydrate, you need fats, and water bound in food with nutrients. So milk, veg juice, or water with lemon and honey added. Something that has water mixed with other nutrients. Without other nutrients, you’ll either piss out the water without it doing anything, or itll dilute the nutrients in a cell. The water needs to contain nutrients

If you are sedentary, a half cup to a cup and a half should be good. Maybe you’d need some more. Just sip it as you want. But never chug. Your body won’t digest any liquid well over an ounce a minute. It can’t break down bulk liquid, it’ll just pee it out. You need to sip so your body can process it well. 1-2 sips a minute, and do not gulp it.

[Meal plan with macro(2022)](https://imgur.com/a/vwJlf6E)  
Now I'm planning to start an easy-to-follow non-keto diet plan where my breakfast and last meal will be the same and only lunch will vary. From past experience, easy prep has worked well for me when I was doing keto. I also plan on doing IF(18:6) and proper gym this time. Currently, I'm doing WFH for the next 6 months so I'll include a 4-6km walk. My TDEE is 2000 cal so I'm doing an intake deficit of 550 cal and exercise on top.

I have a few questions I want your help with,  
Can you suggest a better macro ratio? Should I reduce my carb intake to get better results?  
Should I take any form of supplement?  
Is IF with high carb more difficult than IF with keto?  
What realistic weight goal can I set for the next 6-7 months doing this?

Also please let me if you see any other flaws in my plan. I'm mostly concerned doing deficit IF with such high carb will lead to hunger issues however my previous keto diet with the same deficit didn't cause any such issue. So I'm hoping this wouldn't either.

[I tried six diets. Here's what I learned-Link](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/commentary/story/2021-12-30/diets-new-years-resolution)

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago I was looking for the diet that was ""healthy"" for me. In a sea of conflicting opinions on what that term means and how to achieve it, I would try six completely different diets myself for eight weeks at a time and take measurements before and after to compare results. Each diet taught me something different about my relationship with food. They all ""worked"" for me in different ways. As the new year is here, I would recommend to many a similar approach for many to understand how your body reacts to different ways of eating and help achieve your specific goals. Good luck out there!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

Diets tried: keto, paleo, Mediterranean, intermittent fasting, vegetarian and calorie restriction 

Measured:  blood work, blood pressure, body weight, body fat percentage and compare results at the end 

My key takeaways:

1) Seek out experts. Listen to their opinions but don’t solely rely on them. The reason it can be difficult to find the correct data on food is there’s conflicting information in the literature. Conflicting information means people are responding differently to diets. Let your body be your guide.

2) If you want to be objective, numbers are important. What’s measured is managed. But if your goal is to just feel better, then numbers aren’t essential.

3) Forgive spouses for what they’re about to go through and thank them for their support. I can’t tell you how many times I heard, “I’m not the one on the diet, you are. Feed me normal food!”

4) Being thoughtful about what you are eating has more impact than any one diet. When you focus on what you’re putting in your body, you tend to make better choices both in what you eat and the quantity you eat.",I tried six diets. Here's what I learned.,"I tried six diets.

0,"First post here, so I apologize any possible chance of me using the wrong subreddit for such question. In that case it would be very appreciated if you could suggest me a subreddit fit for my post.

I also notify you that I am not in any way shape or form a medical expert or have parents that are. I'm just a random internet 16 year old heavily concerned about their friend's health.

I have a friend online. We've been friends for over a year, and while in the past we weren't much close, and we simply slightly knew eachother, in the last months our friendship grew exponentially. We started opening up to eachother and reveal things that not even our irl friends know. 
In the past, I kept noticing how my friend did accidentally mention from time to time how they used to ""live in a hospital"", how their mother is extremely germaphobic and is relunctant to let them go outside. I sometimes asked them why was that, but they often ignored the message and switched the topic. While I was very hesitant, and fearful of being insensitive, I couldn't keep my questions to myself, and I used this opportunity to directly and clearly ask them about it. (This happened a few weeks ago)
Turns out, they told me to have suffered from a bad eating disorder at the age of 11 and they were recovered for 2 months, and at the age of 13 they suffered from a worse one, and this time they were recovered for 6 months. In the present day they are 16 and are all clean and don't suffer from such problems any longer. They also told me that they have an autoimmune disease, but I don't know if it manifested or caused after their eating disorder or if they had it since childhood.
This one is the important part. While they described it as ""hyperactive immune system"", I tried to do my searches, and I think they meant an autoimmune disease. They explained how they have to take medicines and blood infusions from time to time that destroy their immune system so that it doesn't damage their body any longer. 

This is the copy &amp; paste of the reply they sent to me after asking them (I know I'm kind of violating their privacy but I really need some advice from you reddit fellas!):

""o i just saw this lol (nux takus new vid is sus and i was watching that... 0-0) two things: when i was 11 i had a really bad eatng disorder and i went to a hospital for that twice, first for 2 months and the second when i was 13 for 6 months, im good now and that isnt a problem anymore. 2) i have a hyperactive immune system so i have to take meds and blood infusions that practically remove my immune system so it doesnt damage my body anymore, my meds now are decreasing a bit so im gonne get some immunity back soooon""

From their behaviour, it didn't seem to me, to be an autoimmune disease that specifically targets the brain or heart, as such a lethal one. And I sure hope this isn't the case. And they never mentioned to be in any way physically impaired. And as such I doubt it is one that affects joints or like a form of arthritis.
They didn't mention having diabetes type 1 either. Because if it was the case, instead of saying ""meds"" I believe that they would have said ""insuline"" since it would be easier to understand for most people.
By searching the most common autoimmune diseases, I came to the conclusion, that what they would most likely be suffering from would be Lupus. Hopefully not a severe form, although the fact that they use blood infusions lends me to believe that this isn't the case...

Anyway, this is the reason why I mentioned the carnivore diet in the title. While I am sure you guys know much more about this than I do, but from what I read the carnivore diet seems to help with autoimmune diseases a lot, and heard of many cases of people practically curing their lupus (although it is supposed to be an incurable disease) thanks to the carnivore diet. From what I read the basis of this carnivore diet is to not ""simply eat only meat"". Eating only steaks all day wouldn't be beneficial. The carnivore diet includes the consumption of unprocessed meat, meat that is plainly cooked without adding unhealthy sauces or condiments, organs (most primarly, the liver), fresh eggs and raw milk.
Do you suggest me to propose this diet to my friend? I think it may help them at least lessen the effects of their disease. But of course, I'm not an idiot. In the case you aggred to my idea, I would first make sure that their disease is actually lupus, but even if it wasn't do you think it would still help as long as it is an autoimmune disease? Second, I would also absolutely remind them to NOT blindly follow my suggestion and just make an internet search and follow a diet. I would tell them my proposal, just as something they can try to ask their doctor or a dietitian and see if it could work with them. As I do know that the effects of a diet, change a lot based on individuals. I think it could be possible since from what I have seen their family doesn't seem to struggle with money.

Please answer to all of my questions redditors, it would help me so much, and I would be very grateful if you could spend your time writing a reply to this.
Thank you very much!",Help with friend with health problems. Carnivore diet?,"Help with friend with health problems. Carnivore diet? First post here, so I apologize any possible chance of me using the wrong subreddit for such question. In that case it would be very appreciated if you could suggest me a subreddit fit for my post.

I also notify you that I am not in any way shape or form a medical expert or have parents that are. I'm just a random internet 16 year old heavily concerned about their friend's health.

I have a friend online. We've been friends for over a year, and while in the past we weren't much close, and we simply slightly knew eachother, in the last months our friendship grew exponentially. We started opening up to eachother and reveal things that not even our irl friends know. 
In the past, I kept noticing how my friend did accidentally mention from time to time how they used to ""live in a hospital"", how their mother is extremely germaphobic and is relunctant to let them go outside. I sometimes asked them why was that, but they often ignored the message and switched the topic. While I was very hesitant, and fearful of being insensitive, I couldn't keep my questions to myself, and I used this opportunity to directly and clearly ask them about it. (This happened a few weeks ago)
Turns out, they told me to have suffered from a bad eating disorder at the age of 11 and they were recovered for 2 months, and at the age of 13 they suffered from a worse one, and this time they were recovered for 6 months. In the present day they are 16 and are all clean and don't suffer from such problems any longer. They also told me that they have an autoimmune disease, but I don't know if it manifested or caused after their eating disorder or if they had it since childhood.
This one is the important part. While they described it as ""hyperactive immune system"", I tried to do my searches, and I think they meant an autoimmune disease. They explained how they have to take medicines and blood infusions from time to time that destroy their immune system so that it doesn't damage their body any longer. 

This is the copy &amp; paste of the reply they sent to me after asking them (I know I'm kind of violating their privacy but I really need some advice from you reddit fellas!):

""o i just saw this lol (nux takus new vid is sus and i was watching that... 0-0) two things: when i was 11 i had a really bad eatng disorder and i went to a hospital for that twice, first for 2 months and the second when i was 13 for 6 months, im good now and that isnt a problem anymore. 2) i have a hyperactive immune system so i have to take meds and blood infusions that practically remove my immune system so it doesnt damage my body anymore, my meds now are decreasing a bit so im gonne get some immunity back soooon""

From their behaviour, it didn't seem to me, to be an autoimmune disease that specifically targets the brain or heart, as such a lethal one. And I sure hope this isn't the case. And they never mentioned to be in any way physically impaired. And as such I doubt it is one that affects joints or like a form of arthritis.
They didn't mention having diabetes type 1 either. Because if it was the case, instead of saying ""meds"" I believe that they would have said ""insuline"" since it would be easier to understand for most people.
By searching the most common autoimmune diseases, I came to the conclusion, that what they would most likely be suffering from would be Lupus. Hopefully not a severe form, although the fact that they use blood infusions lends me to believe that this isn't the case...

Anyway, this is the reason why I mentioned the carnivore diet in the title. While I am sure you guys know much more about this than I do, but from what I read the carnivore diet seems to help with autoimmune diseases a lot, and heard of many cases of people practically curing their lupus (although it is supposed to be an incurable disease) thanks to the carnivore diet. From what I read the basis of this carnivore diet is to not ""simply eat only meat"". Eating only steaks all day wouldn't be beneficial. The carnivore diet includes the consumption of unprocessed meat, meat that is plainly cooked without adding unhealthy sauces or condiments, organs (most primarly, the liver), fresh eggs and raw milk.

this time FINALLY I've lost 15 lbs!! my plan was as follows:

1. eat three times a day
2. eat only my favorite things
3. portion and calorie control (among favorite thing, choose lowest calorie options. my staple foods have become eggs and plantains)
4. keep it simple (no charts of what to eat one what days, no intricate cooking etc)

it's the first time I'm on a ""diet"" yet still eating bread and cheese and candy (if I ever dieted I was always militantly against those things). also I'm not eating anything I hate like carrots or celery.... just no, I'm even saying no to things I like but dont love like cherries and strawberries which have always been kinda meh for me.

this has worked amazingly!

So I got back into consistent lifting and dieting 1.5 years ago. But recently I’ve had some issues with my dieting. I used to put myself in a 500 calorie surplus when bulking up, and a 300 calorie deficit when cutting. However, I have been on a 300 calorie deficit for 8 weeks now with negative results. These results frequently come from carbs. I usually run 1 carb load day for every 3 non carb days. But when I have my one carb day and hit my macros (2500 calories 40% carb 40% protein 20% fat) I end up having a drastic loss of appetite and horrible bloating for all three of my no carb days. 

Even during bulks the carb bloat is so incredibly severe that I can hardly eat. And this comes from even a sandwich made with an English muffin, or a couple skinless potatoes. This causes me to under eat and then miss my calorie goals which I believe has slowed my metabolism/energy to the point where my deficit becomes impossible to maintain and get adequate protein. 

Is there something I should be looking into? Would a blood panel or something help here? I’ve never had this issue and it’s came up in the last 18 months.
