Exercise,"Looking for some encouragement and advice. I was in a rollover crash at the end of May that has left me with a shoulder injury that is still being treated. My back, neck, spine, and ribs have all healed, but my shoulder is still a problem. Concussive movements are a problem, so running is out and walking still causes pain.

Before this, I had worked my butt off for a year to get from 345-225. I’ve crept up to 245 since the accident, and I want to get back to exercise and losing weight for my wedding next year. Nothing as extreme as my original loss… just to get back to a comfy level of health and maybe a little lower than where I was.

Any advice (diet, too… it’s been easy to use snacking as a coping mechanism) is greatly appreciated.

When I was 19 I was told I needed to skate to have the job I applied for(carhop at sonic, so you skate) I decided for some reason only training my left side was a good idea. Here is the results over 2+ years:

Tho I became very good at what I did, I didnt realize my improper form would destroy both my body and skates in the long-term. My right wheel to this day doesnt roll bc the bearings are shocked. Bc all my weight was on the left side of my body. Iliac, tricep,abs, you name it. I decided i'd do one side at a time.
*NEVER DO THIS*

My bed became lopsided bc my left side was too strong to keep an even mattress.
Everyday life became harder as, the way your muscles work, is contraction amd subduction. If one of these is canceled(i.e constantly not subducting the right to lift the left) YOUR BODY will moprh to find a way to do so. Its a a painful process to both do and undo. As today Im practicing on holding my left still while doing the right. Everyday until you become balanced you will be in pain, discomfort. Like something needs to be fixed which mentally tells you you are not in the right place in your life. 

You search for answers where there aren't instead of realizing the situation.( As your body grows accustom to the pain and movement)because youre always uncomfortable you tire quickly,Cant seem to exercise, lose courage etc

It really tells you how the bricks you build your pyramid of, makes and affects the final construct.

I am overweight. Not like unhealthy fat, can't walk or anything like that, I just have too much belly fat. I'm around 162cm (not measured myself for quite a while, but this is approximate) and around 65kg. These are rough numbers, not 100% sure about them.
So, I'm generally not very happy with my body, and I'm really not comfortable with my body around other people. So now is the 13th of October. The summer is coming in next year, and I am going on a summer holiday with a bunch of my friends in August. I wanna transform until then. I wanna be comfortable with my body so I can enjoy my holiday. As I've calculated, it's around 9 months from now.
I really don't care about the number that the scale gives me, as I know that muscles are heavier than fat, so I know I will gain weight if I workout (lose fat, but build muscles). I just wanna get fit and start building muscles (but I don't wanna be a bodybuilder or anything, just have some abs and muscly arms,..)
Currently, I have belly fat, and my chest is big, and I don't know why that is (is it fat too or what?)
I cycle regularly, going for my first 100km ride this weekend, but I won't be able to ride my bike during winter so much.


What is the best way for me to lose the fat? What workouts to do? And can someone please tell me more about calories intake/outtake and how I wanna measure that, etc.?

Exercise,"I’m a 22-year-old male who weighs 157, so that makes my BMI 26.9, which means I’m overweight. I’ve been wanting to do exercise for my health, as well as lose weight. I used to go to the gym at my college, and weighed around 140-145 (can’t exactly remember but it’s around that range). 

However, since the pandemic, I’ve been stuck at home, doing nothing but lazing about and eating unhealthy. Fast-food is sometimes my comfort, and sometimes I eat out of boredom. It’s also been draining my wallet. 

I often eat with large proportions at night, and usually have some sweets too (like iced coffee, which I have to have sugar and milk with). I also eat a large amount super fast. It’s hard to quit, cause I get my cravings a lot. I’m also very picky, and don’t eat a lot of vegetables. I do eat fruit from time to time.

I’ve tried pacing the times that I eat, but at night, I get so hungry that I just want to shove as much food in my mouth and call it a day.

As for the gym situation, I’ve been having a lack of motivation. My college is 20 minutes away, and I often refrain from going due to the effort of driving back and forth. Just to go for an hour. In addition, I go there twice a week, with very late afternoon classes. So I’m drained from that. I also work too. 

I tried a one-day pass at a gym next to me, but I didn’t want to spend money each month. The college gym is free.

I have some equipment at home. I have two 20 lbs. dumbbells as well as a pull-up bar, but get drained easily, and I just want to put them down. For the pull-up bar, I used to do a lot, but now, it’s hard to do so cause of my weight.

I've recently moved to another country all the way across the world, and I'm all alone. With Covid, I have very limited access to gyms and I'm also a student and can't afford expensive memberships. 

I also have a big problem with motivation; that is, getting up and moving. I get motion sickness from some movements (like burpee), my boobs hurt when I jump, and I get bored very easily. (ADD) I have wanted to try boxing for the longest time, but I've asked around and the general consensus is that I'll die if I start with that. I just need to really get this across, when I say I don't move I mean I don't move: I don't leave the housse unless I absolutely have to. This might mean once a week, or once every 3 weeks! I don't do exercises at home either. I rarely even sit on a chair. I'm 99% of the time lying on the bed. (Even as I type this up now) 

I know walking is a good start, but I won't do it. I'll do it for 1 day and then just won't. Is there anything else that can get me off my ass almost every day?! My goal is just to move, and then hopefully like moving and then start going to the gym and losing weight and ... For once in my life liking how I look? But for now, I just want to find something/anything that means moving. I do enjoy swimming, but I'm so very shy about going to a public pool and it's also difficult with Covid. I can't think of anything else tbh, so I'm hoping someone has an advice for me. Thanks.",I have no idea where to start and nobody to ask for help with exercise,1634076834

I’m starting to pull myself out of the slump and want to get back into it. These days, I have a new dog so im walking her at least one mile a day in addition to my normal amount of walking. I’m also cutting down on caffeine and drinking more water.


Thing is I agreed to do some sporting events that are happening end of October through November, and its coming up faster than expected. First one is in 2.5 weeks and I don’t want to look a total fool.


The sport mostly relies on leg and core strength, and cardio is decently important too. 


Based on my personal schedule, I can only manage to go to the gym 3 days in a row followed by a rest day, and I can be at the gym for 1 hour each day.


What kinds of workouts can I do on this schedule, with a timeline of 2.5 weeks, to improve my fitness so i dont totally flop at my sport events? should i do legs, core, and cardio each day or have one day at a time to focus on each? any ideas are great, thanks!",i didnt work out for a few months and now i need to get as fit as reasonably possible within 2.5 weeks. ideas?,1634056894

so, when i returned to the gym and lifted heavier weights and did machines, i really thought i'd be insanely sore. like after some leg days at home with only the light dumbbells, i'd be sore and wobbling while i walk for a couple days after. so i'm really surprised i wasn't at that level of soreness after leg day for the first time, just slight soreness.

is this normal, common, expected? what was your experiences returning to heavier weights and machines after months/years exercising at home? could it be be that the at-home workouts have you doing standing, non-machine exercises more often, so it gets you sorer compared to machines where you may be sitting? idk, i'm just surprised! maybe i should try to change up the machines i use at the gym or do more free weight type stuff.",Anyone else get more sore doing at-home workouts than higher-weight machines?,1633911794

Exercise,"Background: I was bulking for 10-11 weeks starting in May, then cut for six. Now I'm back doing a bulk and my weight has stopped increasing. Granted I hurt my shoulder so I'm taking it easy on a couple fronts, so some lack of weight increase isn't surprising.

What is surprising is that, I started working out where I stay at max reps for all my exercises until I can complete all the reps for every set of every exercise, then I move it up. So if I have three leg exercises, and two are at 50 lb and 15/15 reps per set, but the third is at 50lb and I'm doing 14/15 for any number of sets, next week the weight stays the same. Otherwise they all go up to 55.

More importantly, my muscles are significantly more sore doing this than they were when I was cutting or initially bulking. Could this be a cause of a protein deficiency?

So I live in an area where gyms have been pretty spotty about letting people use their equipment.

2) How should I diet to maximise losing weight? I do want to gain muscle as well, but my priority is losing weight as that causes me the most distress.

Would I be good for me to be more active in my day-to-day, would it be necessary? Should I avoid sitting for too long? I hear that you should always have breakfast as it starts up your metabolism, is this true? Anything that I should be aware of!

I had a baby 6 months ago and had a rough recovery (emergency c-section, lots of blood loss, infection etc) but have been signed off for exercise for the last three months. Prior to having a baby, I didn’t do much weight lifting, I was more cardio- I ran 5 days a week averaging 40+ km per week. Not being able to exercise in pregnancy and for three months afterwards was a mood killer and tough on me mentally and physically.

For the past three months I have been working hard in the gym. I knew I couldn’t just get back to running everyday without injury so my training schedule is as follows: two runs a week of 5km each time (building distance up gradually, I’m finally at 5k without needing to stop for a rest), three gym sessions per week (I run for twenty mins on the treadmill and then do a mixture of weights and body weight exercises- back squats (I’m upto 40kg so far), deadlifts (I’m at 80kg now), chest press etc, for an hour each session.

Exercise,"Hi all,

I'm a 31 year old male, 5 foot 9 inches and I have been on the keto diet for 12 months and have so far lost two stone.

I now weigh 11.5 stone but I still have more weight to lose so have signed up to a local gym to try and speed things up.

My main aim is to lose my man boobs but I'm aware I can't control where weight drops off so was wondering if anybody could help with some advice/ recommendations?

If I do 15 min cardo session each morning accompanied by 20 min weights each session focusing on my chest area - high reps low weights - will that not promote weight loss in my chest area? I'm talking no weight at all, and just the bar, surely if I'm not boiling muscle this movement will be doing something?

&amp;#x200B;

I bought a spin bike yesterday off of Facebook market place. I thought I was buying something used - but when I showed up it was in a box. I didn't think much of this at the time, but as I was driving home it dawned on me that this was probably a bad sign. Live and learn. While I was assembling the bike, I noticed that the wheel doesn't fully line up with the brake pad all the time, because it isn't straight - it's slightly curved. The wheel has a wobble to it, when you pedal it lines up perfectly with the pad, and then moves to the right, then to the center, then back to the right. It never completely leaves the pad - but it goes more than half way off before coming back. I've been looking around online to try to see if this is by design or not - but I can't find any information on this. The brand (HONRISE) doesn't even seem to have a website? Just third party retailers. [This](https://www.amazon.ae/HONRISE-Exercise-Shock-absorbing-Cycling-Adjustment/dp/B08FHTGQ33) is the model, I guess they don't carry it on Amazon where I'm from (Canada) because this links to the UAE.

I’ve never lifted weights before. Everything I’ve done has been bodyweight fitness/cardio. I want to build muscle at a fast rate, and I’m not sure if I should go with weightlifting, calisthenics, or a combination of both.

Exercise,"The weather where I live is finally getting nice enough to run again. A friend of mine invited me to go running on a really nice scenic run weekly that is about 10 miles in distance. I'm running into an issue where even though my cardio health feels fine - I'm not getting super elevated heart rate, and my breathing seems OK, and I'm not uncomfortable in that aspect, I find that my legs just absolutely start locking up and tightening. It gets really uncomfortable as early as 3-4 miles into the run (we load up the first part of the run with hills.. there's two ways to go and we can either take the hills at the start or the end, which we opt for the start).  

The other activity I take part in is crossfit 3-4x a week. I have been at it since about October of 2020 (so close to a year now) and we do a lot of leg workouts there, but most of our running is sprinting. The massage therapist I go to mentioned that my IT band is like a rock and that it shouldn't be that way. We do a lot of leg work outs at my gym, but I usually have 2-3 days of rest before the 10 mile run which is typically enough for any soreness / fatigue to go away. So I'm usually starting the run pretty fresh.

I stretch before and after every work out (including the run), and roll out my legs often, and even do cupping treatment on my quads / IT band. 

I guess my questions are:

* Is loading the hills at the start of the run a bad idea?
* Does anyone have a recommended video on youtube or something that could help me identify good running form to avoid this?
* I wear Saucony shoes and am curious if it could partially be my shoes causing me to ""hit the ground"" in ways that are wiping out my legs quickly?
* Obvious question is.. I can run the 10 miles and it sucks. Should we cut it down to 5 or 7 for the first few runs? I take a couple of breaks on the run now, but it's an addicting feeling. I go out there and burn 1500 calories on my run at the start of the day and I just feel serene for the remainder of the day. 

Other thing to note is that the feeling I get isn't really muscle fatigue. It's just a general tightness in my legs and discomfort.","Legs ""locking up"" while running - curious if anyone has any strategies to avoid this",1633105777

Im mainly just posting this because it was very eye opening for me. I’ve researched “which cardio is best” and the answers seem to vary.

Exercise,"Hi folks,

I'm hoping a few of you have encountered this and have some advice on how to get past it. While in quarantine I really let my cardio health slip and I promised myself that when I got fully vaxed, I'd throw myself into exercising. I turned 30 this summer and heart health has been an issue in my family and it's something I want to avoid. Since I started doing a lot of cardio I feel loads better. However, I feel like I'm hitting a plateau in my cardio exercise. 

My routine since mid-June has been to do about 30 minutes of high intensity interval training every weekday morning. My fitness trackers on my apple watch showed noticeable improvements on an almost weekly basis. I could feel the progress and it was really encouraging. In the past couple weeks I increasingly feel like I'm hitting a wall though. Whereas before, when maybe 45 seconds to a minute of high intensity exercise would get me to my target heart rate, I now have trouble getting up to and holding my target heart rate. It's not that I'm exercising less intensely either, if anything I can tell I'm putting in even more effort than before. It's basically like my heart health has improved so much that the old exercises aren't as much of a challenge anymore. 

I've tried upping my goals, going more intensely in my interval training or trying to do longer intervals and I've had some success in that. Except past a certain point I feel like I just run out of gas. Basically, it feels like my cardio health is so good now that I don't have the energy when I exercise do actually give my heart a workout anymore. In some ways, this feels like a good problem, but I'm frustrated because I'm still not where I want to be in terms of my overall heart health.

If anyone has thoughts/suggestions or has encountered this in the past please let me know!",I feel like I'm plateauing in my cardio health,1632170900

is it likely my body appearance will change from this? it might sound silly but i don't want to lose features i like, like my bum and thighs. i have a fairly healthy diet if that's relevant too. if my body will change, is there a way to minimise/avoid this? thank you for any advice!",newbie advice - body changes,1632072508

Exercise,"So for a while now I have been wanting to get into shape. Its been a long time since I've had an active life style (9+ years) and felt that it was time to change. I went out and bought a smart treadmill and installed it in my garage and started my fitness journey. 

I started jogging/walking 2 miles every day (except for sundays) for 1 month total. I made sure I had a good stretch 15 minutes before and after my sessions on the treadmill. It was going great and I was working up a sweat every time. I felt good and it was going smoother than I had imagined it would. I was watching my calorie intake, making sure I had enough carbs and protein for fuel and making sure that I was always hydrated all the time. 

After this one month passed of me exercising consistently, I can feel fatigue in my legs/calfs. I can get out of and into bed fine, but walking for a decent period of time and attempting to go for my usual jog/walk on the treadmill is impossible right now.. No matter what position I am in whether its standing or sitting for a long period of time, It feels like my legs are shaky/weak. I can feel it especially in my thighs and for a short period of time it felt like I had shin splints. That eventually went away, but the fatigue in my legs is still present and slowing me down.

Exercise,"Right now, I'm in a bit of a rut. I go to work, then go home, that's about it. I can't use the gym at work anymore (they're still requiring people to book ""time-slots"" to protect against covid), and there's only one ""gym"" within 30 min of my house,  and it seems mainly dedicated to being a yoga space, no real weights or anything.

For reasons beyond this, I'm considering moving, but have considered either investing in a stationary bike, or possibly an electric bike (hear me out before dismissing it!).

Honestly, my *only* goal right now is weight loss. So burning calories is great, but just as important *for me*, is just ""time spent doing *something*"", that isn't thinking about eating. I've never been in great health, but I've definitely noticed that the more bored I am, the more I tend to ""snack"". I've gotten rid of pretty much all that type of food, but I feel like I need some sort of mental stimulation.

The other idea I've considered is picking up an electric bike. The idea honestly never crossed my mind, until a coworker of mine was talking about it, and mentioning he feels way better. I sort of laughed at first, thinking ""don't those things basically ride themselves?"", and his response that he only really uses the ""electric"" part of it, when he's going up particularly difficult hills, or if he's been riding all day, and just feels exhausted.

He made kind of a compelling case for it; that when he had a normal bike, he only went for a ride once or twice a month, but because the electric bike deals with ""the hard stuff"", he's actually going riding pretty much every day because it's so much more enjoyable. Particularly if I wind up moving back down south near my family, I could also see something like that being useful for my father, who has back issues but really *needs* some amount of light exercise.

I mean, at least with the electric bike, at the very least it provides some amount of ""entertainment value"". For a stationary bike, though, I'm unsure how useful those are for actively burning calories, or if that's just an expense that's realistically unlikely to make much if an impact on my actual weight-loss journey?",Are stationary bikes -- or electric bikes -- an effective way to burn calories?,1631722237

Hi guys so I'm new to fitness and I need advice about my chest injury. I did some delt stretches with cables two weeks ago and I'm pretty sure it caused my chest injury due to incorrect form. I'm not sure how serious it is but it has been plaguing me for 2 weeks now.

I first noticed it when washing my hands or hanging my towel but I thought nothing of it. A couple of days later it still didn't get better but it is barely noticeable so I had my chest day (bench press, cable fly, dips, push up). I didn't feel any pain until the following day when I sneezed really hard. From then on it seems like the pain increased sharply. Washing my hands no longer hurts but it hurts if I sit up from a lying down position. It hurts if I sneeze or cough or have hiccups. But it doesn't really hurt if I do bench presses or push-ups which is weird. Wider push-ups hurt a bit more though.

I took some meds a few days ago and it seems to be getting better but just now I sneezed really hard again and all of the pain came back. Btw I stopped doing ALL exercises since last week. Idk if I should go see a doctor or physical therapist. For routine, I mostly copied Athlean X's perfect exercises.

Edit: It hurts the most if I do a particular core exercise: Opposite side elbow to knee when in the plank position and I try to touch my left elbow with my right knee while supported by my right arm and left foot.",Need advice on chest injury due to exercise,1631280706

I used to jog/run and did it pretty consistently, did some 10k races and a half marathon etc but honestly it made me very depressed and anxious. The majority of the time I would either get a panic attack or feel so low that I would harm myself after. So I said bye to that, but I was probably at my fittest then (2019). I love hiking and hillwalking but don't have any peaks near me, so can only go inconsistently. I love walking but feel like it doesn't do enough to raise my heart rate. I have a gym nearby but the cost and not knowing what to do scares me. I used to go to a private gym and work out in a small group, but I mainly ended up on the side with panic attacks (I was also super depressed at the time lol). I used to skate on a roller Derby team which I loved, but covid ended that. I also used to do yoga semi regularly but now I'm out of the habit when I don't have space inside. I've tried getting into a routine of body weight exercises but they rarely stick and when I go hard, I just panic badly. 

I have a small outside space that I can use. I've tried looking for bodyweight routines on YouTube but I'm lost with where to begin. Everything just feels so overwhelming. I've recently changed jobs which allows for a lot more time to exercise, I just don't know what I can do and where to begin. It sounds dumb but I could cry thinking about it. I have GAD so that might go some way to explaining it, and I feel like this is all actually classic GAD avoidance/excuses because it gives me a lot of anxiety about getting panic attacks.

Exercise,"GOOD MORNING EVERYONE!

What a day to be alive. Hope you’re all striving towards your goals. 

I just wanted to write this to anyone pushing late nights/ early mornings/ struggling to do either. Whether it’s working or not, I’m proud of you for making the decision to change. 

I was once where you were. Wasn’t happy with my body, was eating junk all day long, was pretty depressed and was giving into instant gratification all day long because I didn’t have that motivation or drive to get to where I needed to be. 

I know a lot of you have been trying really hard to either get your body back in shape or come back from a dark place. Some of you want to start exercising regularly, while some have been doing it and not getting results. Some just need to make that mental change. I understand you. 

It’s crazy looking back at the old me now. I was so lost. I’m just here to tell you that your destiny is completely under your control no matter who you are. Everyone has a different story or a different way they need to approach their goals, but all of us are going to make it. I’m not going to settle until I get everyone in this group to their goals, or simply changes their mentally so you all can get at your goals yourselves. 

The old me used to watch YouTube all day long. It took me a while to realize why this was, and now almost 3 months later, I can now say that I’m exactly where I need to be. 

You can do this. Current you struggling = future you proud. We either do it now or regret it later. 

My goal is to change 1000 people’s lives this year. I’m already at 255 starting from March. Whether it’s mentality, weight loss, muscle gain, getting into running or anything else I’ll probably be the right fit. 

What are you struggling with currently? I’ll see if I or someone else in the comments can help you.

Exercise,"I've been listening to the Huberman Lab podcast and in episode 19, he describes a study where cooling your palms in-between sets radically increased the number of reps a person can do (300% for dips!).

The idea is that hyperthermia limits performance and cooling through the extremities prevents that.

Huberman claims that this methodology is being used by lots of sports teams and that they've been getting great results.

Frankly, this sounds way too good to be true.

[There are a number of peer reviewed papers demonstrating the effect](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22076097/), however:

* They're from the original authors, who started a company to commercialize the technology
* The company was founded in 2000 and don't appear to have been able to bring anything to market in the last 20 years.
* I found a couple examples of replications that don't show anything like the effect size the original authors see, plus the results don't show a proper dose/response.

I'm tempted to try this myself to see if there's any validity to the claims (easy enough experiment and claimed gains are enormous).

About at the beginning or middle of July, I got a gym membership. I started going about 3-5 times a week.

I usually reserve weight lifting for the weekend since it's empty. 3 sets of 15  60 pounds bicep curls and 3 sets of 15  60 pounds barbel chest press.

Exercise,"Beforehand I'd like to mention that I'n not exaaactly sure this is the subreddit to ask, as I've never really relied on reddit for exercise tips. Nonetheless, here is some elaboration:

I'm a 21-year-old 162 cm (5' 4"") male. I started walking for exercise on the streets of Lebanon after finally putting myself on a program to lose weight. When I started, I was 105 KG/231 lbs. I dropped 7 Kilos down to 98 KG/216 lbs. This was all between July 16 and August 27.

I started walking exactly 1000 steps/0.4 KM a day and gradually increased it to 13,000 steps/10 KM (which is the most I've ever walked in a single day) These walks I do are on Lebanese streets, which are far from the standard flat-surfaced sidewalks in other countries. Throughout the program, I've not felt much pain from the walking besides the standard soreness and, once, numb feet for a few hours after a walk.

Now, three days ago, my family and I went up to our village in the mountains, and I decided to take a break from walking for at least a week while I'm there. After resting for a full day, I woke up the day after with severe pain in my Knee Joints. They don't hurt when I cross my legs or keep them straight, but hurt like a motherf***er everywhere in between. It's very hard to walk in the house, let alone a 13,000 step walk.

Three days have passed with me sitting most of the time on my bed, feet straight and a pillow underneath, and yet, nothing has really changed. So, as I sit here wanting to go on the beautiful escape that is a long walk, I decided to ask reddit to find out the source.

It's a small grocery store where I'm the only employee at any given time, and I mostly either sit or stand and wait for customers. Now I was wondering if there were any exercises I could do while there's no one there, it's not a very popular store and I can go hours without a customer, so I can set aside a while to exercise.

After day 1 I realised that I'm in no position to finish all the exercise that were a part of day 1 (squats, weighted curls, planks etc) because I was not able to do any of them for the prescribed 50 seconds time.
I think that I should first concentrate on getting my strength and endurance up by slowly building up to be able to finish day 1 properly and then continuing the 14 day regimen, but my friend thinks that I should half ass the daily exercises and finish the 14 day regimen in 14 days (because doing just day 1 repeatedly is pointless and useless, according to him) 
My point here is that if right now I can hold only a 15 second plank and I'm just okay with that level of stamina and half ass all the other exercises, what exactly am I gaining here?

I have a treadmill that's been sitting in the basement for a couple years, a couple weeks ago I brought it out and made it usable again.

In my past attempts to get fit, I've had a pattern of being too ambitious and either burning out or hurting myself. This time, My strategy is to start with a long term plan to gradually ramp up. My treadmill has speed increments of 0.1 mph and inclination increments of 0.5%, so from 0% inclination at 2.2 mph to 10% inclination at 10 mph, there are 1659 combinations of speed and inclination. If I do a different combination every day, it should take me about 4.5 years to work up to max out my treadmill. I've read that 4 miles per day is a sustainable amount of exercise without wearing out knees, hips, etc... So my tentative plan is to do 4 miles a day, each day at a different combination of speed and inclination, until I'm maximizing out my treadmill.

I've made a spreadsheet to track my progress...

I know this may sound stupid bc it is too obvious to some people, but i really do not know what to do and would genuinely appreciate some advice.

Context: i lost 10kg (22 pounds) due to gallstones and since i’m waiting for surgery, i do wanna recover at least 5 kg as too skinny from my perspective. The problem is that my round gets fat easily, and i will try to avoid that.

Should i do some concrete exercises to prevent that, or do i just have to train all my body? i honestly do not know if that way the fat would become muscle or something like that (if you could explain it to me or smth but that’s opcional). As you can see, i’ve never trained in my life haha.

Exercise,"I’ve recently started riding a stationary bike, at home.  I noticed two nights ago and tonight, that my sweat has started to smell like ammonia after about 45:00min.  I read that this is muscle being broken down because I haven’t had enough carbs and my body is burning muscle for energy.  Tonight I had pasta for dinner about 2-3 hours before my work out and I had a protein shake at lunch that also has carbs in it.  My goal is to slim down and gain muscle at the same time by working with free weights EOD.   What exactly do I need to eat and how long before the work out to prevent this, from happening?  Could this be that the supplement Whey Protein shake is really what smells so awful being sweat out instead of muscle protein?  I’m ok with that I guess.  I don’t know what other info you need,  I ride for an hour at an average of 16 mph, and am able to keep my heart rate bouncing between cardio and peak zones.

1) when i go to the gym, i usually just use the machines because i otherwise have no idea what i'm doing. is that good enough to gain muscle?

2) are there any good, reputable workout regiments online that are tried and true to help bulk up?

3) i'm not a huge fan of the belly i've got. i'm by no means obese or fat, but i'd really like to be more lean. i know a lot of this has to do with diet, but if i consume a lot of food in order to bulk up, wouldnt my stomach get bigger too? and if i do cardio to lose weight, wouldnt that cut back on the calories i'm trying to gain to gain muscle?

Exercise,"I am a 5ft 4in female. 22 years of age and go to the gym 3x a week, MWF. I started at 215 lbs and am now 212 lbs. I have been exercising with this routine since July 8th. I am trying to lose 70 lbs by this time next year to start. Is my workout regimine going to get me to my goal within 1 year? What can I do to target fat loss in addition to this? I currently cook all my meals and eat chicken breast, and half of my meal consists of a nutrient dense veggie like Kale, Spinach, cauliflower, mushroom etc... I don't like pasta or rice but i make 1 cup of rice and that lasts me 4 meals. I'll usually make rice 2 or 3x a month for filler. I'm trying to cut out most sugar and replace it with fruit. Most of the time I don't eat breakfast or I'll have a protein shake when I get home. However I do snack heavily and am cutting down on buying junk food to replace with whole foods. I eat Sardines or tuna as a late night snack, but slip up with junk sometimes so I don't buy it anymore unless I've been consistent for 3 weeks straight. Also no more food orders except for 3x a month. 

My workout includes: 

3 sets of weighted sumo squats with 10 reps each. Set 1: 10lbs. Set 2: 20 lbs. Set 3: 35lbs
100 bicycle kicks
50 side crunches on each side
100 crunches
10 minutes walking on a treadmill 

Hip adduction/abduction machine (5 sets of 10 reps at 100 lbs for abduction and 60lbs for adduction). 
Leg press: 5 sets of 10 reps @ 200 lbs of weight. 
Hamstring machine: 50 lbs 5 sets of 10 reps. 

For arms I use bicep (25 lbs 10 reps; 5 sets) and tricep machines (35 lbs 15 reps; 5 sets) as well as a rowing machine.  This workout will take me about 2 hours then I walk home mostly and get about 7,000-10,000 steps in to and from the gym since I'll walk to the grocery store to pick up veggies before I head home and feel energized. I don't feel tired after this workout and have seen a big improvement in my strength, but I'd like to lose fat as well. Or am I just being impatient? 

I got this workout from the personal trainer at my gym but want something to target fat loss as well since I haven't seen physical results in fat reduction after over 1 month.",Trying to lose weight and tone up. Am I doing this right?,1629493626

Exercise,"Hi,

Something I’ve been curious about for some time is the issue of whether protein ingested long before a workout will actually aid in muscle protein synthesis, or if it will simply be used for energy.

There’s information about eating windows online, but much of it pertains to whether protein ingested a short time before a workout will aid in growth. Obviously, if you have been working out with weights within 48 hours of the meal, then your body will be a heightened state of protein synthesis inherently, so in that case it’s easily assumed that protein intake early in the day will aid with that.

Exercise,"Hi everyone.

I used to love jogging on the Wii Fit. (Well, not “love”, exactly, but “hate marginally less than other forms of exercise” sounds a little negative.) It was very simple: put the controller in your pocket, and its accelerometer would determine your approximate jogging speed as you ran on the spot, with your avatar running through a much nicer world than the one you were actually in.

That was fourteen years ago. But I can’t find anything that comes close today. The closest I can find is Zwift, but leaving aside the fact that it’s littered with endless menus and lists of stats and is clearly aimed at serious people who do lots of running/cycling, you have to buy a pretty expensive “foot pod” to actually make your avatar run at the speed you’re jogging at. I have a treadmill (my wife’s anyway), but Zwift’s own foot pods seem to be permanently out of stock and alternative ones are hopelessly expensive.

There’s an app that promises to get around this: Treadmill Smart Speed, which you put on your phone and then use the phone like the Wii Fit controller of old, sending your running speed via Bluetooth to Zwift running on another device. This is exactly what I want! Except that it doesn’t work. It doesn’t register my speed most of the time; when it does, it has a huge lag; and it sends the speed to Zwift only intermittently.

So this is my question. I want an experience like Wii Fit jogging, where you put a phone or something similar in your pocket and a character on your TV screen runs through a virtual environment accordingly. Ideally I’d like it to be something simple enough for a small child to use - just like Wii Fit itself. Does anything like this exist on any platform? Or are we stuck endlessly running round Wiifitty Island for ever more?",Running games?,1628603058

Exercise,"I injured myself doing squats. I’d been doing them every day for a few weeks when I started noticing that my lower back was getting sore. I thought it was just regular tightness from working out. 

One morning, my lower back was stiff and even sitting down hurt. I realized it wasn’t pain from building muscle, but pain from overuse or poor form. 

A friend of mine took a look at my posture and said I might be overextending my back. 

I’ve heard that when doing squats, you should always keep your knees behind your toes and your butt should stick out. I think that might be why I overextended my back. 

I’m not sure how to continue doing squats, as I don’t want this to happen again. I’ve had to stop my workout schedule in order to allow time to heal, but two days ago I tried to work out again and the pain got worse again.

Exercise,"I am 5’11” and have reduced from 82kg to 78kg (for reference, I was 76kg when I moved, but actually looked bigger than I am now - would post picture If I wasn’t self-conscious)

I used to be really active, and I played cricket at a pretty decent level before I moved very far from home (other side of the world). I know what it takes to ‘workout’, and had a set routine based around the sport I played. I could go to a gym and know what I was doing to benefit my performance. Since moving away, I can’t really play the sport (the standard is not really good enough to commit the time taken to play), but I remained active in other pursuits and felt healthy. 

During these Covid times, I gained a little weight, and have managed to reduce a little myself at home. I don’t really have the time to make it to a gym to work out in the way I am familiar, and I don’t really want to be around other people in a place that encourages spread of virus/bacterium.

I am not familiar with working out at home, and have limited materials.

I have been basically doing 4 day, trying to work on specific areas with the equipment I have (very minimal) and I am looking for some variety, or organisation of activities to maximise benefit whilst not increasing time. 

Equipment:

* Skipping rope
* Push-up handles
* Resistance bands (reasonably high max load)
* Dumbbells (you know the York ones in a box, not high max load)
* Recently bought a rowing machine (identical to a c2 - stoked on this tbh)
* Yoga mat

I’ve basically been rowing 30 mins a day (no skipping) or 15mins rowing and 15mins skipping depending on how I feel (side note I hate running, but sometimes run 5k), along with targeting - Chest/triceps, back/biceps, Shoulders/core and Legs

I am wondering if anyone could help me to:

B) help to suggest exercises to help with getting bored doing the same thing/suggested exercises or muscle groups to target on specific days",Help needed to spice things up,1603323805

ok so first things first: please do NOT tell me about the balance between weight loss and muscle growth. That does not answer my question at all. I strictly want to know how long it would take someone to make their abs noticeably larger.

For example, if someone were to go from the right picture to the left picture, how long would it take. [http://www.leighpeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/10-percent-body-fat-male-pictures1.jpg](http://www.leighpeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/10-percent-body-fat-male-pictures1.jpg)

(and please don't tell me the time it takes depends on the quality of the training either. I want advice that's actually helpful...)

Exercise,"Hello everyone! First post here so sorry if anything is off.

I always worked out in my life, because I have a back problem and depression, so exercises helped me relieve my back pain and helped me stay happy. However I did pilates in a group of 4 people from 12 to 20 years old, and from 19 to 21 I started belly dancing classes and zumba, and I realised only then I didn't like working out with other people, so I quit everything and started working out alone at home. Everything was perfect until the pandemic came.

Before I woke up early, did my exercises (just dance, wii fit and solo workouts, varying each day), took a shower, breakfast and went to college/work. There were days when my laziness got the best out of me and I slept until I couldn't, but most days I was happy with that routine.

Now everyday seems a huge effort to get out of bed to do the exercises. I sleep until few minutes before class/work and eat breakfast while watching the professors and working. I really need tips on how to get motivated again to wake up early and do my routine. I'm starting to gain weight and I really don't want that after all my effort last year.

Exercise,"I am new to exercising. F24 and i'm pretty thin bordering on underweight i've always been this way no matter how I eat so I have started exercising to at least build some muscles. I always get problems whenever I try to exercise in the periods I have tried. I've gone to the physical therapist my fair share of times and gotten exercises from him because I suffer from overpronation. I have had shin splints three times, the last time (a year ago) it got so bad I had it for 5 months and needed ultrasound treatment because nothing else worked. I get shin splints easily, I had only gone on walks then. My mother suffers from arthritis, for many years they told her she doesnt because it wasnt visible on x-ray yet and  now its gotten to a bad point and not until then have they said she has it. I have asked doctors and my physical therapist if I could have it but they say its impossible due to my age. The reason im wondering is because maybe its a reason why I get so much pain in my joints when I do certain things and maybe then I should exercise differently.

Now when i've exercised i've first started experiencing hip-problems on the right side. I've only done mild exercises, stretched too and nothing intense at all. Yet after like 2 weeks my hip started snapping whenever I lift my leg so now I cant do many of those exercises. At first there was no pain with it but now there's soreness in my right hip that comes and goes randomly. My thighs are sore too and feel very weak even though i've rested for like a week now, it just started hurting as soon as I try to do ONE squat. It feels painful right above my knees and the whole front of my thighs hurt. It even hurts to stretch them. And i've started experiencing back pain and shoulder pain since I started exercising those body parts which I also do very carefully and now I haven't done it in like 2 weeks or more but it still starts cramping randomly. My back hurts when I walk. I don't know if that has to do with my overpronation or if it's something with my back itself.",Problems with exercising,1603199603

Exercise,"**TLDR** what kind of exercise mat is best for planks?

Currently doing 45 second planks, and just started doing 17 seconds side planks. 2 sets.

Problem with the side planks, is that I yelp in pain whenever I try to support my weight with my left elbow on my hard wood floor. I don't know why, but it's been the case whenever I've tried to do it, which is for about six weeks or so. Just seems that that part of my body is particularly sensitive. 

**So I've had to resort to using this cheap, rubbery, stretchy mat that my aunt gave me. Problem with that is I can feel it stretching beneath my feet and forearms while I'm planking. **

Does this reduce the effectiveness of the exercise, given that it's probably forcing me to change my posture while I plank? If so, I obviously need to invest in a better mat. So what kind of mat should I get for planking?","Doing planks on a stretchy, rubbery mat?",1603085321
Exercise,"Hello! I would first like to note that I am new to exercising and my goal is to lose as much belly fat (I'm around 20-25% and weigh 135lb)as I can and increase my weight. I would also like to build muscle throughout my body with the limited equipment I have.   


My first question is the right/amount of food to eat? I would say that I eat similar to the average person with the exception of breakfast as I go for brunch. This may vary from pasta, meat, etc. Dinner is 100% rice mixed with mincemeat. On the side I drink a little water, 2 canned coke zeros, and milk.   

As for my exercise, I exercise every day mostly on cardio. It is before dinner where I start off with this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sEeVJEXTfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sEeVJEXTfY) and then hit the treadmill for around 45 minutes (usually the first 10 is just walking) and end my exercise with the same video above. I also ride my bike on occasions depending on the weather, it's getting colder outside so I don't go out as much as I used to.

Exercise,"My (25f) boyfriend (31m) hasn’t exercised in years due to back/health problems, and wasn’t super active apart from biking/skating before that. He’s really underweight and is challenged by 10 minutes of very basic exercises- (jumping jacks, dead bugs, hip hinges, squats.) His nutrition is really poor and he smokes.

I want to help him come up with a safe exercise routine so that he can build endurance, strength, and kickstart other healthy habits so he feels good. He doesn’t like feeling out of shape either and wants to make these changes. 

After a while the idea is to increase the exercise time and maybe see a doctor to do a full health evaluation, so for now, is it enough to do 10 minutes of the very basics until he can get through that? Should he do 10 minutes of basic exercises and follow it with a walk? Is it enough to start feeling a change after a month? 

He is the nicest guy and I really want him to experience feeling physically healthy and prevent any health problems now or down the road. I’ve played competitive sports my whole life so I also don’t want to push him too hard too fast. Thanks for any input!!

Exercise,"I don't know if this is a good motivator or not, but I finally decided that im just going to do cardio. I will not seek to lose weight, gain muscle, endurance, or anything. The reason being is because I always find a reason why I can't. You have to exercise at the right time, after you eat, but you have to wait a certain amount of time after eating so you can avoid bloating or something. But there are too many interruptions within that 30-45 minutes that you are waiting. You get asked to to to the store, your younger siblings want to hand out, bla bla bla. So finding time is difficult. I also worry if I'm doing the exercise right. I may think im doing it right but no my pelvis needs to be in a certain position. Because it wasn't, I did the exercise for nothing cause now I'm not going to get the correct results. 

So now, I'm just going to get my heart rate up. That alone is good and healthy enough. Exercising like that is better then not doing it at all. I don't even need to lose weight.

Exercise," 

This might be a bit vague and unreasonable as well, but I wanted some advice. I have been working out pretty consistently for the last 3 weeks. I work out Sunday through Friday for about 1-2 hours. I do strictly cardio. Right now, its been exercise bikes on high resistance, 30 minutes on a stairmaster at about 60 steps per minute, but occasionally lowering it because I can get pretty tired. I also started using a rowing machine this week, and I like it. I also tried lifting weights for probably the first time in my life a couple days back, and I really pushed myself and felt awesome about it, but I have been SORE as hell the last two days so I haven't done it again yet. I likely will tomorrow.

Anyways, I am working out to lose weight so I can join the military. I started at 232 pounds, started dieting about 2 months ago, and working out the last two weeks. I am now at 218ish(it fluctuates by a couple pounds). I am trying to lose the weight as quickly as possible because I hate my lifestyle right now and have wanted to join the Army my whole life but never really did anything about it. So I have the following questions:

1)Is strictly cardio a bad idea? Should I also include muscle exercises regularly throughout the week?

2)Is doing cardio OTHER than running a bad idea? Will I find it easier to run the more cardio I do that ISN'T running, or do I need to run?

3)Is six days a week too much to work out? I have heard that I need recovery days so I picked Saturdays.

4)My heartrate will occasionally hit 190BPM and very rarely a little bit higher when I am pushing pretty hard. Is this dangerous or natural for my weight and inexperience?

Today's example, according to my bike, I cycled for 58 minutes, I crossed 28.5 kilometers and burned 650 kcal. That means my speed was 29.5 km/h (18.3 miles/h). 

If I put that in online calculator, including other info (male, 25 years old, 184cm (6ft) and 85kg (187.4 lb) ), I burned 950 kcal.

Every time I do squats even with no weight my knees crack and crunch and then are in pain for a few days after. They hurt more than the burn of the squat!  And the sound and thought of them cracking really puts me off the squats too even if the real pain doesn’t come until afterward.

Exercise,"Hi everyone, please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit to post this on.

I have been unhealthy for quite some time now (no exercise and eating a lot of fast food). I have decided it's time to change. I have tried to start working out many times before. Every time I try, I tell myself I will take it easy in the beginning so I don't get burnt out, but when I am nearing the end of my first work out I think ""fuck it, I am already working out, might as well push myself as hard as I can"", and I do so, but then I am completely unmotivated to keep going the next day, and just quit.  I am in no hurry to get a shape, I just want something that will keep me healthy in the remaining approximately 60 years of my life (I am 20f). So, I had the idea to start with something ridiculously easy the first day, but make it harder over time. An example would be to do 1 push up a day on days 1 and 2, and every other day I increse it by 1, so in a years time I would be doing more than 175 push ups a day, and I don't see how I would end up quitting. I can for example set a maximum, and once I hit that maximum I will stop increasing it. I am interested to see what peope think about this plan, and any tips you have. I have some specific questions as well:

1. Should I focus on just one thing like push ups, or should I have some variety? For example, let's say on a particlar day my ""number"" was at 30, then I could do 15 push ups and 15 sit ups for example.
2. Is it important that I spend some time in the beginning before starting figuring out how to do these exercises with the correct form? At the moment I am pretty much clueless about form for push ups, sit ups, etc.
3. Which exercise, or exercises, would you recommend I do? I don't have any specific goals like building muscle or anything, I just want to make sure I don't die early haha
4. What is a suitable maximum? I realise of course this depends on which exercise or exercises I choose to do
5. Should I take break days? Or perhaps days where I do less than usual? For example rather than going 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 22, 23, 23, 24, 24, etc. I could do 20, 10, 21, 10, 22, 11, 23, 11, 24, 12 etc.
6. I would prefer to pick something that is easy to just knock out whenever I want, like for example while I am cooking I could knock out a few push ups, then later in the day I could do another few, etc. Will it be fine to spread it throghout the day rather than doing it all in one session?

I work out in my condo using a set of adjustable dumbbells and body weight exercises. I do pretty much only weights and zero cardio.

I find that during my workouts, I become completely exhausted to the point I feel I cannot continue within the first ~ 20 minutes of working out.

For example, today I did 10 sets of goblet squats with varying amounts of weight (body weight to bodyweight +50lbs), 3 sets of bodyweight lunges, and 2 sets of Bulgarian squats. By the time I was done all of this I felt sick to my stomach which seems unusual because it took me all of 25 minutes. I had to stop and go shower cause I didn't think I could do another squat.

I was wondering if this could indicate a deficiency, poor cardio health, or something else. Thank you for any information.

Exercise,"Pretty much the title..Hello everyone, hope you are doing well!

I'm going to post a little background about myself and my fitness goals. I'll also post my concerns and what's holding me back from starting. Any advice for some or all of the categories will be greatly appreciated. Here goes:

What: I want to start with a realistic fitness goal.. nothing over the top. Probably 30 minutes for 4-5 days a week (as I imagine rest days are needed). I want to do a multiple, different exercises (a program, for example push ups, stretches of some sort, followed by lunges..I don't know) that require NO equipment (except the floor and walls). I also prefer to exercise alone. Speaking of no equipment...

Where: I prefer to do my exercises completely at home..hence, no gym equipment. The park is ok as well when the weather is nice. I just don't like gyms: the distance, the ambiance, the cost, the sweat on the equipment, thinking about where to store my stuff, the people (I'm somewhat antisocial..Hur Hur), it just does nothing for me.

How: This is where I need your help. I need your help as to which ""equipmentless"" exercises I can do at home. Perhaps 3 or 4 different types that I can do in a row for a grand total of 30 minutes?  

Desired result: I don't expect nor desire to be jacked (like the stereotypical bodybuilder). I suppose I want a lean or somewhat toned look if that makes sense. I'm currently skinny in both the arms legs (with legs being much stronger). I have a very slight gut, but I want it to be a least flat. In the end, I want to feel more energetic and stronger in the upper body/arms  (though I'll train the lower body too obviously). I'm a guy in his mid-twenties for context.

My experiences with exercise: My experiences have ranged from meh to mediocre/indifferent at best. In high school and college, I have tried various weight training programs with little reward. While I've achieved short term results while I was in enrolled in such programs, I wouldn't go back to the gym when the mandatory programs ended. I don't know..I just didn't enjoy using weight training equipment..I liked how I felt afterwards sometimes yeah..but it always felt like a chore . The coronavirus also doesn't encourage me to go to an enclosed space where everyone is rapidly breathing..no thanks.

Conversely, I plunged myself into Tai Chi for a short period and really enjoyed it. The reason I don't do it now is the lack of a structure or teacher (and being lazy).

The only current exercises I do regularly is long walks (everywhere..I have no car). I also stretch..but only for a few minute intervals when I need to feel better (after working on my computer for a while).

Things holding me back:

1) Too many choices and conflicting information: The number of exercises available is numerous. Worse still, the advice that follows is of often confusing and conflicts with other advice. Looking this shit up is mentally taxing. I'm also confused by the various definitions, methods, blalabla.

2) Diet modifications: I typically eat in moderation and avoid junk food..no problem there. I'm mostly concerned as to how much stuff I have to ADD if I start working out. Do I need to learn new recipes? How many servings of this or that? Do I simply add protein to the dishes I already know? Should I drink a protein powder (which is often expensive)? Ugh..

3) Lack of structure: I don't want to go to a gym.. maybe I can read your exercise suggestions and search them on YouTube. I don't want to half-ass it without knowing if it's getting me to my fitness goals or not. I also want suggestions for how many reps or sets for each exercise if possible.

4) I don't enjoy it: I'm trying to change this attitude..tai chi gave me this sense of hope. Perhaps other ""equipmentless"" exercises can do the same. I see the benefits, have genuinely enjoyed it a bit before..and wish to take the plunge. 

5) Fear of improper training: Lastly I fear that I'll exercise ""unevenly"" if that makes sense. I don't want to focus excessively on one muscle area over another as I risk the injury and akwardness that comes from an unevenly developed body (hence those skip a leg day jokes online). I don't know how much time or what exercises to dedicate to which part of the body..hench the confusing and conflicting information that come from the fitness world.

Sorry for the long text..I just hope I was as clear as possible in my text. Thanks again!",I need your help getting started in exercise,1601711978

Exercise,"Hi! 
I’ve been running as my main form of exercise for quite some time now, but lately I’ve started to get this intense pain in my stomach after a few minutes. It started like two weeks ago, and after a few days of having to cut my runs short- I also started having breathing problems (also outside of running). It lasted until I got medicine for asthma (I have not been diagnosed with it, my doctor just gave me the medicine). So, yesterday I brought the medicine with me and everything went rather smoothly. I struggled to breathe, but there was no pain. However, today there is and I am once again unable to finish the run. It’s so annoying, and I don’t know what to do. Has anyone struggled with this before, and what can be done to make it a little less uncomfortable? Thank you in advance!",Pain when running,1601462085

Exercise,"Hi there.

I have been cutting for last 9 weeks and I plan to do so for 3 more weeks. My body fat dropped to 15 percent. My target is low-to-mid 13 percent but I dont suppose I can reach that in 3 weeks. I am planning to go little aggressive on my diet for next 3 weeks.  I am so used to dieting now that I would probably not want to lose my leanness after 3 more weeks. However, at the same time, my gym performance is not improving for the obvious reason.

Is it a good idea to cut for more than 12 weeks when you have been able to reach 13-14% body fat and a good FFM with around 80 percent muscle mass?

And, how long should you bulk? Is 12 weeks an ideal time?

My plan right now is to complete my cut and then go with 2 weeks of maintenance and then start bulking.

Thanks.",How long should you cut?,1601440656

Exercise,"Hello, I am starting my weight loss journey, I rarely measure myself, and I don't want to focus on the weigh itself, but I still want to keep on track somehow. 
I thought of buying a diagnostic scale that measures body fat, bone mass, muscle mass etc. and mainly tracking body fat as that is what I want to go down. 

I bought one of German brand, so I assumed its good ahaha...

All in all I am 21F, weight 66.5kg with bf 29.8%, and muscle mass of 35%. Water percentage is around 51%. And in theory everything seems to be around average, except the body fat that I'd like lower, but I am not sure of the muscle mass? 

I am not sure if this is true to the state of my body, as I checked the ""average healthy stats"" online, and seems my muscle mass is in the ""high"" for women my age. I do think that I have pretty bulky legs (thighs and calves) since forever, but I don't exercise regularly tbh and I have no strength at all (I can lift heavy things like bags of animal food or cement etc and maybe carry them a few meters, but I can't do a single push-up for my life), although I did some weight lifting for 2 years like 3 years ago, but since then I did nothing. I have always eaten a lot of protein (meat, eggs and milk, as I live on a farm) so maybe that's another reason.

Exercise,"Around last week I started making a commitment to visit the gym regularly for cardio workouts. For most of it I’ve been doing mildly brisk walks (3-3.5 mph) on moderate inclines (2.5-4.5) for 60 minutes. 

Today I felt dissatisfied with how low my heart rate was, so I switched to 4 mph at inclines from 3.5 to 5, with longer “active” intervals and shorter “rest” intervals over a 25-minute period. I’m not fit, so 4 mph is a jog for me, meaning this was considerably more intense. 

My peak heart rate for this exercise was about 40 to 50 bpm higher than my 60 minute one, and my average heart rate was about 30 bpm higher.

I was satisfied with that, but I was unsatisfied with the fact that I couldn’t keep that pace up for longer than a minute or two, and had to lower the intensity in broken, irregular intervals—mostly because something is wrong with my left leg that makes it tired very quickly when walking or running. 

Because of this, I was left conflicted. I wasn’t sure if I was pushing myself too hard or if I wasn’t pushing myself hard enough. Though I was tired and sweaty after the session, I still felt like I could keep going, and wanted to, but I’m not sure if that’s because I actually could or if it was just runner’s high.

I’m not quite sure what to do going forward, and was wondering if any cardio enthusiasts had any advice. Should I lower the intensity? Increase the duration? Should I switch back to the 60-minute one for now? Should I cycle between them?","I experimented with a shorter, higher-intensity cardio workout today, and I’m not sure how I feel.",1601140447

Now that all of that is out of the way, here's the deal. I'm trying to exercise, but, of course, my heart just seems to have a brisker pace. So, today, I did a very basic treadmill exercise, some inclines, but, never faster than 2.3 MPH and incline no higher than 12. So, beginner treadmill routine. I kept adjusting the speed down when my heart rate went over 185, but, one time I missed it and accidentally got to 202. I shut off the treadmill immediately and just walked very slowly around my living room until it came down into the 170s. 

For heart rate, I wear a Polar monitor, the basic chest strap version and the results are very similar to the fitbit I'm wearing. So, I doubt both of them are wrong. I can count my own pulse, but, obviously hard to do when it's that fast. lol

Exercise,"I've been weightlifting for about 3 months now and watched several weight training YouTubers and read several related articles but seem to get conflicted results. I'll list them below and hopefully someone with experience and knowledge can clarify them up for me.

* Frequency of Training
   * Some articles and videos suggest training every single day for a fixed amount of days is perfectly fine. (i.e. Train 5 days straight Monday - Friday, weekends rest)
   * Other info states you must rest every other day (i.e. Lift MWF, rest TThF)
   * Same story with certain muscle parts (i.e. the biceps - the biceps are a small muscle group, which some articles have indicated that they can be trained every single day. Others have conflicted and stated they need more time to recover since they're small)
   * I personally do a full-body workout since I'm a beginner
* Eat Window and Protein Amount After Workout
   * The math on this one is all over the place. I currently weight 165 pounds. About how much protein do I need to intake after my workout?
   * Is it true that if you don't eat after a lifting session, you just wasted your time in the gym?
   * What's the window after you leave the gym to consume the protein?

Exercise,"Hi. First time poster here. I am a 61 yr old woman, who, until recently, lead a very sedentary life. I owned an elliptical for year, used it rarely, and hated it every time. I finally sold it and got a treadmill. 
Since getting it over a month ago, I got the iFit app and have been using it religiously, only taking 1 day a week off. 
Recently, I've been doing a series of the Grand Canyon South Rim, down to the Colorado River, and back up to the top. I just finished part 9 of the series, and here is my take.
Today's interval training, going up the Grand Canyon, to the South Rim, from the Colorado River, was 19:46 minutes of pure sweat and hard work. It was an elevation gain of 219 feet, .86 of a mile, with an estimated calorie burn of 120. All of it was up hill, mostly a steep climb, in intervals of a normal walk, to a fast walk, 2/1 ratio. I did it though. I didn't slow down, or reduce the incline, but rather, was able to keep up with the trainer this time. It is part 9 of this series. I am not sure how many parts are in this series, but will continue for as long as I can, trying like hell to make it back up to the top.

I've read posts from other people doing 5+ mile hikes, and even longer and harder. But for me, someone who's barely exercised more than walking into the kitchen to get coffee, this is a huge thing. I've been doing this for over a month now, religiously, taking only 1 day a week off.

So far, my rounded total stats for my treadmill adventures are:

Total Miles: 41
Total elevation gain: 3,347
Total Estimated Calorie Burn: 4,401
Total Time: 16:19:08

Not gonna lie. I am proud of myself for changing my negative inner talk, only to once again fail. I am committed to continuing as long as I can, and making this a lifestyle of healthier living.

Exercise,"I’ve been regularly working out since February and up until recently I’ve been happy with my results.  I’ve lost weight and increased muscle mass a bit.  In the past few weeks I’ve found that during and after some exercises I feel great, strong, and energized.  During others I feel exhausted and totally wiped.

I started doing some research and I think that I might be doing too many sets.  I’m pretty inexperienced when it comes to exercise, so as I progressed, I simply increased reps and sets.  Now I’m thinking that’s not necessarily the correct method to gain muscle.  My regular exercise routine is:

Jump rope x 120 - 5 sets
Push up x 25 - 5 sets
Sit up x 30 - 5 sets
Dumbbell bicep curls 30 lbs/arm x 10 - 5 sets
Double arm tricep extension 30lbs x 17 - 5 sets
Pull up x 7 - 5 sets

First off- I know I need to incorporate lower body exercises into my workout.  Jump rope isn’t enough.  I hope integrate that when I change the number of sets.  Second- am I correct in thinking that I should decrease the number of sets I’m doing?  

My goals are to increase strength, gain mass (I’m 5’10”, 132 lbs), and stay toned.  I’ve considered doing a couple sessions with a personal trainer to get a good routine down.

Since xmas and partly due to stress during the pandemic... I've gained 8kg.

&amp;#x200B;

So a few weeks ago I started walking 2-3 times a day... I can't do much as I have a spinal problem as well as a major problem with one knee and a pretty knackered ankle... old injuries from soccer when I was in my teens and twenties that mean I can't run any more.

&amp;#x200B;

I started out slow... half a mile would take me 15-20 mins and I'd do that twice a day. I'm now doing a mile in 15 mins.

&amp;#x200B;

I've slowly built it up over 4 weeks and had lost 2kg... then for some reason... and no.. not over eating... and after increasing my walking distance each week to 2 miles a day... I put it all back on in one week.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I've increased my walks even more... I'm averaging 2.5 miles a day now and at an average speed of 3-4mph

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm stuck at this weight and can't seem to shift any of it... My food intake is around the 1500-1800 calories a day mark, I'm drinking at least 1.5-2lts of fluids a day. My carb intake is probably a little higher than it should be... but I have some dietary issues and am unable to get the recommended 5 fruit/veg a day (only have 1/3 of a stomach left).

Exercise,"Hey everyone! I've noticed recently since I got back to the gym 1.5 months ago that my right hip has been getting tighter and tighter and right now it's kind of radiating pain. My left side is fine. I'm flat footed but I'm able to hold my arches up when needed to ensure proper alignment. However when I go really deep the arches do start to collapse in (so my heels don't lift). My right foot is slightly more flat that the left. I have extremely long legs and a short torso so squatting is already kind of difficult for me to get right. 

my current lower body routine, not necessarily in this order (crowded gym I have to be flexible):  
\- leg press (high/wide stance, feet slightly pointed out)  
\- smith machine squats w/ glute band  
\- hip thrusts w/ weighted barbell and glute band  
\- cable kickbacks  
\- calf raises

So I have two theories, the glute band I'm using is pushing my legs to close together during squats causing them to twist inward OR it's the feet collapsing or combo. I've heard of thrusties causing hip problems too. Just curious if anyone knows where I should start so I don't make this any worse than it is.

Exercise,"Heres some context. I'm 24 yo, 6'0"", 178 lbs, play sports here and there when there isnt a pandemic. But never worked out. Not bad, but I'm not in shape at all, just getting bailed by high metabolism/youth/idk I'm not knowledgeable on the topic.

Ive tried many times to be fit, but this time around I've done some actual research beyond ""good workout for biceps, calistentics"". Before I was doing like 5 or 6 random upper body exercises for 4 sets. Then the next day lower body/core. Then rinse and repeat for 6 days, taking sunday off. 

This didnt work, I wasnt tracking my progress, I had no idea what I was doing, no goal, no idea what exercises progress (like if I can do 5 million pushups, what's next?) When to add reps, sets, or move on to a more difficult exercise. Soon I became unmotivated, and I started doubting myself, thinking wow it's a month and a half and I see no results. Probably doing it wrong. 

I was impatient for sure, but I'm happy I was. I know I'm doing slightly better this time because my upper body exercises are split into Push &amp; Pull Days with the 3rd day being Core &amp; Legs. So Mon &amp; Thu Push, Tue &amp; Fri Pull, Wed &amp; Sat Core &amp; Legs. I was also running 3 miles on Wed and Sat.

My biggest issue right now is how much I'm struggling with (what feels like on paper) a small amount of exercise. 

My push days are 3 sets, 5 reps each as recommended by some fitness site.
Diamond Pushups, Dips, Pike Pushups, Decline Pushups, and Bench Dips. 

Pull is also 3 sets, 5 reps of Pullups, single leg deadlifts, chin ups, and upright prayer rows.

I started doing 5 of everything, and each week added 1 extra rep because I read progressive overload is important. However, I struggled doing this workout. Pretty much on the 2nd set I would start hitting failure at like 3 dips. After that I couldn't do any of my exercises completely. I'd stop half way, stretch my arms and barely finish. 

So my adjustment was to cut back everything to 5 and only add 1 rep to 1 exercise per week. And I started giving myself a 30 sec break to stretch my arms between every exercise. I still struggled so much, and it frustrated me. Am I just weak as shit? 

It annoys me because I feel like on paper my AB &amp; Core workout is the hardest. I do both in one session. 

Lower Body, 3 sets
15 Squats, 10 Glute Bridge, 15 Calf Raises, 15 Lunges, 5 Inchworm 

ABs 3 sets
25 Crunches, 45 secs Planks, 5 Knee Raise, 30 secs Russian Twists, 30 secs Plank Twists.

I feel so good doing these exercises. I sweat like crazy, I feel my abs burning, I reach a struggle each set (esp on the planks, last 10 secs my body shakes). But that struggle doesnt turn into failure. I'm progressing every exercise, and taking no breaks while doing a set. The struggle while being able to still finish feels like (in my head) what my upper body exercises should feel like.

TLDR - The difference in upper body exercise vs lower body/core. 

Upper Body - No momentum, constant breaks, once I struggle the workout declines so much its unmotivating, no progression being made because I can only do one set entirely correctly. Feel stiff but never sore.

Lower Body/Core - No breaks needed, get a good sweat, feel the muscles burning, feel sore after (for a couple hours, sometimes all day), feel good about myself once I complete it.

So what am I doing wrong? I cant go any lower in upper body exercises right? I'd be doing like 2 dips, 1 push up, lol do you even progress at that point? Any tips for me? Going into this I thought my core would be by far my weakest area.",Struggling so much with Upper Body Exercises,1600148571

I recently sustained a serious injury (knee, already operated on and many months down the line) and I'm annoyed at myself for not seriously thinking it through before.

I personally found all the standard health/activity trackers like the average sports smart watch, (android) health apps, etc seem to not have, say, a section that takes into account an ""unusual"" situation. i.e. injury or say if you're a regular wheelchair user, you may not have a proper ""step count"". And you couldn't convince me without serious evidence that crutch use isn't as, if not more, intense as walking! 😅

I imagine such apps may be off putting because they're designed for a person who is generally able-bodied. And the ones that connect to ""communities"" are also comparing you to majority able-bodied people, providing encouragement on the same basis.

Besides, my situation is temporary, what about those for whom injury or disability isn't? Are there apps that do? Maybe I'm not looking in the right places?

Or remember seeing a video on ab exercises which was clearly done in this fellas mum's basement, sweating and cortorting and making exercise look like a particularly painful constipated shit by someone who is too focused on their faux-masculinity and not on being a well rounded individual. And there's a whole range of other faux-masculine nobends on YouTube that is forcing me to go watch the opposite sex, which is no bad thing.

((There's a TLDR at bottom if you don't wanna read a bunch))


So for a few months I've been walking on a treadmill for 30-45 min a day, and 3 weeks ago I made it so I walk an HOUR a day. I walk about 2 miles a day on my treadmill. 


I also am eating 1,200 calories a day. (I went to the doctor for a checkup and told her this- she had no issue with it. Don't worry). I've cut out most carbs and sugar, except for a very occasional toast or small serving of cereal. 


My mom said she doesn't want me to weight lift but maybe I can talk her into getting me some 5 pound weights so I can build some muscle? The gym isn't too far but my family is always busy so its not like she can just take me there every day. 


About a year ago I got an ultrasound on my throat to see if I had thyroid issues, and I also got blood work done. Both the blood work and ultrasound came back fine even though my neck looks big and I have issues losing weight. A few of my family members had issues so I easily could have them. (I'm saying this just so you know it might be harder for me). 


How do I lose weight super fast??? I literally hate my body so much even though I'm not even 200 lbs. I want to be skinnier every second of every day and it just makes me so upset. 


Obviously nobody can give me real medical advice. I just need basic info..

Exercise,"My mom is 64 and has hypertension. She could afford to lose 20 pounds, but has a busted knee that is holding her back.

She has full control of her knee and it flexes well, but has fluid in her knee due to busting something in there. We live in Spain and the doctors are telling her she’s still too young for knee surgery (I don’t know what the hell they’re waiting for; a miracle?).

When we go out for walks she starts to experience pain in her knee around the ten minute mark. She’s a fighter through and through so you won’t hear her complaining, but I know she’s in pain. She has developed a bit of a limp due to this.

She does enjoy going out on bike rides. However, we use the city’s electric bikes because they’re softer on her knee, so I don’t know that it’s really putting a dent on the weight loss since it’s mostly riding for leisure. I know any bit of activity is good, but she only gets to ride on her free days as she does 24 hour shifts at the clinics she works in. At work, she isn’t on her feet all the time, and she isn’t busy all the time, she’s just on call for whatever patient needs tending to. This gives her plenty of free time to do SOMETHING in her private room to keep her weight under control.

Yoga and running are mostly out of the picture, as most of the poses put a lot of stress on her bad knee and my mom wouldn’t be able to kneel for child’s pose much less assume a table top position or transition to downward dog; and running or walking would just aggravate her knee even more.

Swimming is a nice option but again, I need to show her something she can do every day and not just on her free days. 

My main goals for her are: weight loss and avoid further aggravation of the busted knee.

I love my mom and I want to see her get better. Losing weight would also lift her self esteem and she deserves to feel happy about herself.

If anyone here can recommend any exercises that can work around her limitations I’d appreciate it very much.

Exercise," So she was out of the pool from late March through mid-July, and like the rest of us, was a bit of a lazy slug. Got out of conditioning, put on 8-10 pounds. Coach found a local pool in a park they could use, and so they resumed practices for 4-5 weeks in mid-July through a couple of weeks ago, plus we started watching more what we were eating, and she did lose a few pounds (She is right now about 5' 6.5"", 130 - she was about 135). But that pool closed a week or two ago. So we started jogging

My daughter goes back to swimming in a few  weeks, and Coach has demanded that all the girls keep a regular exercise  regimen, so I'm having her do short distance running: miles and  5Ks. Problem is, she's a bit out of condition, and she has no real technique/form for running. I don't even know how to give her a good pre-run stretch routine, or how to monitor if what she is doing is  optimal in terms of pace, stride, and minimizing the impact on her  knees, hips, and back. 

She  did a 5K three days ago, and she was miserable the last 1/3 of  it. Like wailing in discomfort. But to her credit, she did not stop and  never slowed to a walk, and she ended up with a not-great-but-not  terrible time (average about a 10:40 mile, I think it was around 32:57 -  I'd like to get that down below 30:00, preferably below 28:00, which  would be a 9-minute mile pace). She said her chest was hurting, she had trouble breathing, she kept feeling like she was going to puke, towards the end anyway. She got some side stitches, but those went away. I was happy-ish with her 32:57, because 5 months ago, I had her run a 5K just to see if she could still do it (I figured for a competitive swimmer, it would be easy) but she ran a dismal 35:31. So I was happy with the big improvement the other day. 

The day before yesterday, I took her out  for a mile - which I figured would be super easy -  and she clocked a not-so-hot, but decent for her, 8:44 (if I  remember correctly). And again, she struggled with pain. of course, she was not pacing herself as gently as she tried to do for the 5K, but she can swim 400m (500y), so I figured jogging a mile would be a breeze. I guess not? 

I mean... Her  times are decent times for a kid off the street, but not for a  competitive swimmer who needs stamina. So I need (she needs) an expert's  help 🙂

She has never enjoyed exercise, and she doesn't even enjoy swim practice all that much. She is the typical teen with multiple devices and distractions, and would be a couch potato if I didn't threaten her to get off her butt. Today I told her to get ready for her run, and she plopped down on her bed and played dead. But I know that most of it is because her stamp is such that she knows, going into each run, that it will be unpleasant. And that once she got into better shape and running a 5K was less demanding of her, she wouldn't mind it - just strap on her music player and go.

So  I am now monitoring my waist. I am 1.84 (at the higher end of 6'0'' but  feet and inches are less accurate than cm and ml). Blood work is  health, not cholesterol, muscle mass is ok (not a gym buff by any  means), and I do have a small beer belly which is expected for a 41 yo  man. The belly is more noticeable when sitting down but if you see me  standing you will say I am actually skinny.

Having  said all that my waist is 95cm which is on the border. I'm looking at  this one chart and they say a 6'0'' man can have a 75cm waist and be  healthy. I really don't think so. They will be deemed a freak if they  ever existed. This body frame simply does not exist (someone with 75 cm  waist and 185 cm high - the hips will be too narrow.)

But here's the real issue: my environment. No matter how much I improve myself will fix the world around me. Did you know our society is completely backwards? The reason our species can display such intelligence but also barbarism is because our development was easily won. The planet supports human life perfectly. Hunter gatherer tribes collected some crazy variety of nutrients that people nowadays don't get anymore. Agriculture was basically a stupid fucking idea which a few of the shittiest members of our species used to create capitol and enslave the rest of the world. Thats what we mostly are. Slaves to money and impulses and those are both controlled by very few people. There's no way to argue against that anymore. A few people have all the money in the world while there are others starving in the streets. And everyone else just tries to be content with what little they have. And all of it reflects in us. I spend most of every day working a pointless job making money for the few people who are literally killing the planet. And I come home to my sad mother. When I look in the mirror I see someone strong and beautiful and brave. And its going to waste because I also see a history of bad men. We're not lazy or stupid. We're strongly affected by the shitty actions of others who we have no control over. Our society is a deadly waste of time and it will end some day because of that. As will I and my role in it. The reason I know all of this is because, when I'm at my worst, the only thing that gives me strength is the chance to see all the people I love smile again. But I feel as though I never will. Because it would be my eyes looking at them. For clarity, I am an American.

I’m super unfit. Well, I must be. I have a normal BMI, but before two weeks ago, I never used my muscles or my cardiovascular system for anything other than walking around the house. 

Then two weeks ago I started doing home workouts, mostly leg and butt exercises. The first time I did it, I was super sore for the next two days. On the fourth day, I did it again, and I felt only a little sore. After that I worked out my legs/butt every other day, and I haven’t really felt sore since. I haven’t added resistance bands/weights to my workouts, but I have increased the number of reps.

So, my question is, am I doing something wrong? Do I need to add resistance/weight already? It seems odd to me that my muscles would get stronger after only two workouts, especially since I consider myself very weak, so I feel like I must be doing something wrong.","If my muscles aren’t sore after working out, am I still getting any benefits?",1598284401

when I was younger, I was SUPER fit and did all sorts of physical activities.  now I'm old (well, 30) and chubby, but I recently came to the realization that I still love doing jumping jacks and jump roping (and even pogo-sticking, if I could trust myself to balance), but I'm just too chubby to really enjoy those things.  the way my stomach flops around hurts enough that I give up pretty early on.  I keep thinking to myself, ""if i diet and lose a little weight, it'll be much easier to exercise!"".... but I've been yo-yoing with the same 30ish lbs for the past 3 years.  and then I get a depressed and eat myself back into my heavier weights and have to start all over again.


so I've decided to just start trying to add some exercise to my routine.  disciplining myself to do it every day is going to be a real serious challenge for me, I know, but it'll be a lot easier for me to  get motivated if it didn't hurt so much.  I know that it'll be hard work and I'll be sore, but if my belly (and boobs) could just stay in place a little while the rest of me bounced around I know I'd give it a better shot.

Do you think it is possible to expand the lung capacity through deep breathing?

I take as deep of a breath I can through my nose, then gradually add more and more air through my mouth by sucking the air in by the corner of my mouth, then shut the lips and swallow air down. This way I am able to fill the lungs up really full. When I can't fit any more I just keep it in for a while.

Exercise,"Hey folks,

I (17M) am considering doing the above for 30 days to see if I can get some definition in my core/ upper torso and arms. As background, I am 1.82 metres tall and weigh 60kg. I am underweight, although not by much, and have never exercised like this before in my life. I am a pretty decent runner, and can run 5km no problem in about 20 minutes, no breaks. I started doing both exercises today, and got through 1 minute of plank no problem. I did 20 consecutive push ups in maybe around 40 seconds, and then took a 10 second break, did another 10 push ups, took another 10 second break, did another 10, and then took 20 second breaks and did 4 more sets of 5 push ups until I got to 60 push ups. All in I don’t think that’s too bad for someone who never does this type of exercise. 

So the question at hand. I am not asking for instant abs, or huge arms, my arms aren’t terrible as it stands, but they are not at all defined. I have a flat stomach, but again, not at all defined. So I am asking here if the above workout every day for a month or so would get me some definition in the mentioned areas, even if only a little, but still a noticeable amount?

Exercise,"I've gotten more and more into grip Training this year, while I thought my functional fitness training would aid in my grip strength I've learnt that to do more pull ups and to train myself up to the one arm fingertip plank I need to focus more on specific grip Training.

I'm not reinventing the wheel you can find everything online but haven't seen many posts on grip Training and forearm mass on this forum. 

There is a major advantage to having great grip strength, your grip is the last thing to go, ever shake hands with an older gentlemen and think damn are you shaking my hand hard on purpose ?? Take it easy. 

It also can help adding more reps to your pull ups and push ups, building up great strength endurance, or it can help with your jujitsu or wrestling.

Ever shake hands with a wrestler ? They are one of  most powerful athlete's out there. Alot of boxers back in the golden days of Jack Dempsey use to train grip/forearm  Training regularly, he was one of the hardest hitters of all time along with Rocky Marciano who put a boxer in a coma for awhile with his powerful punches.

This is something I wish I would of trained more when. I first started bodyweight training, but better late then never try not to rush through the progressions slow and steady wins the race 

Push guide 
First progressing 
Knee push ups on knuckles (pronated position) 
Knee push ups on knuckles (neutral position) 
Do 2 sets of 20 on each exercise, once you have comfortably completed all reps and sets go on to the  next progression 

2nd progression 
standing fingertip push ups
Stand against the wall with your fingertips extended 
For best results aim for a 3 second tempo while in the flexion position then press away. 
2 sets of 40 reps. 

3rd progression 
Vertical fingertip push up 
Put yourself in the pike push up position but extend your legs a bit further then a standerd pike push up see where your most comfortable extend your fingertips and proceed to do the pike push ups with your fingers extended. 
2 sets of 20 

4th progression 
Fingertip push ups on knees 
Standard push ups  elbows close to your body but again extend your fingers and proceed to do push ups 
2 sets of 20 

5th progression 
Fingertip plank 
Hold the plank for 1 min for 5 sets add 30 secs to your plank every week until you can get to 4 mins each plank 

6th progression 
One arm finger tip plank 
Hold as long as you can and build from there it's a very difficult feat to hold for a minute from here sky's is the limit for you.


pull progressions 

1st progression 
Standing row hang 
Best on a post hold the post with your fingertips and pull back griping the post with all your strength using your finger tips. Hold for 1 minute 8 sets 

2nd progression inverted/Australian row hang 
Hang for 2 minutes while keeping your body straight and core on 

3rd progression bar hang
Grip onto the bar and just hang once you feel your forearms starting to burn acivate your shoulders and bring scapula down just like a scapula pull hold for 2 minutes 6 sets 

One arm hangs 
Same as above but with one arm hold for as long as possible then switch sky's the limit when you reach this progression hey it might help you achieve the one arm pull up an extremely great feat to pull off

Over the last year I’ve bounced back and forth between different exercise programs recommended to me and my own plan that I made. And none of them have given me any results. 

I’m committed to my insane task of trying to lose body fat and replace it with muscle. But nothing works. And at this point I’ve lost motivation because what’s the point of trying something if the chances of it actually working are so low, especially for something so time consuming.

I know there are no guarantees when it comes to exercise.

Seeing results in a short amount of time in really important because it keeps you motivated.

A rewarding thing to hear is when a client says they got a compliment from other people noticing their body changes. Although it's good to be toned, there's other benefits you'll get. Other areas of your life like work and leisure can improve.

When it comes to body toning, you're looking at working the muscles, getting your heart rate high, and keeping controlled meal sizes. The better you do and the more effort you put into doing these things, the quicker you'll see changes in the mirror.

Initially you need to be patient for a few weeks and put in the work. This is why I created my online coaching platform. It keeps you going in those first few weeks while you might not see changes instantly. This is the time that most people either give up, or lose hope, or put in less effort.

I track clients progress, and make sure they're completing the exercises with quality. My online platform and coaching techniques allows me to do this. And that's how you're going to see changes. You'll be energized to push yourself hard.

She, I feel guilty writing this, but, does have a body of someone who has never worked out. If it didn't bother her, fine. But it does A LOT. She doesn't have muscle tone anywhere but is about 20 pound overweight. Her weight is steady.  And here's the kicker.  She's not trying to be a body builder.

When I get home from my walks I’ve been seeing that my heart rate is still quite elevated, around 120bpm for the first hour then 100bpm the second hour. Is this normal?? Not knowing if this is normal or not causes me to have panic attacks which make my heart rate even higher and breathing quite difficult.

I, and my doctor, have concluded this hat I can no longer lift heavy weights, even lightweights can hurt with certain exercises. I would love to stay active and quite frankly I get depressed and more anxious without weights. I have been running for the past 6 months without it disturbing my back too much, which is so great. But, jogging will take a toll on your back eventually as well. I believe light weights on machines are another option and a preferred one if true. No more axial loading exercises as well.

Hi, I’m doing research for my PhD into how weight loss issues can affect mental health. I would really appreciate it if you could fill in this questionnaire which should take about 10 minutes. All the questions are multiple choice so it’s very easy to complete and you don’t need to to write anything. You’ll only need to give a first name and your answers will be anonymised. You can also withdraw from the survey at any time.

The more responses I can get the more accurate the data will be which is really helpful:) I hope this research will help to bring mental and physical treatments closer together which I believe can only be a step in the right direction.

Exercise,"I am 29F and very overweight (250+ lbs).  I’ve been unemployed throughout this whole covid crisis and spend most of my days either sitting or lying down.  I’ve always been sedentary, always been in pretty poor shape and always had pain in my feet and low back.

As time has gone on with this pandemic, I have noticed a sharp decline in what little fitness I might have had.  The act of taking out the trash, bringing in the laundry, or even just walking from my car and into a building leaves me winded for several minutes.  Washing the dishes makes my low back lock up painfully to the point where I nearly collapse as it refuses to hold me upright any longer.  It’s not just embarrassing, it’s scary.  There is a history of type 2 diabetes and heart disease in my family.  I want to get myself back to a better place health-wise and I was going to start by just taking one short walk around the block per day.  But is that starting too small?

I'm a very small (4'11) 23F and I haven't done any kind of exercise in a very long time. I notice the lack of exercise is affecting my mind and my body. I feel like lately my muscles are losing their strenght and power. Since I'm in a bad place atm it's been difficult to get motivated to exercise. For example, the only time I have to work out is in the mornings and I can't do mornings because I have trouble getting out of bed for that purpose.


My question goes in two categories:

* Which exercises are good to start to get more ""in shape"" without really leaving my home (bc of covid)?? I heard skipping rope is good.

* What is a good way to motivate myself to get out of bed and do exercise?? 

*I thought of a third question: any good online exercise programs or apps?

Exercise,"I'm a 30 year old male and used to be relatively fit about 18 months ago and was able to play tennis and squash at a decent level however after a 13 hour plane ride something went funny in my head and I now get motion sickness playing sports and even running on a treadmill. 

I've had all the tests since then to rule out serious problems like an exercise stress test, heart ultrasound, MRI, bunch of blood tests and nothing serious has shown up. My blood pressure is fine and sugar levels fine. 

I've avoided exercise in the last 18 months because of this and now am feeling quite unfit and my asthma seems to be flaring up a bit (I'm on medication for this) which I feel is due to me being inactive and spending so much time indoors.

Hi, I’m doing research for my PhD into how weight loss issues can affect mental health. I would really appreciate it if you could fill in this questionnaire which should take about 10 minutes. All the questions are multiple choice so it’s very easy to complete and you don’t need to to write anything. You’ll only need to give a first name and your answers will be anonymised. You can also withdraw from the survey at any time.

The more responses I can get the more accurate the data will be which is really helpful:) I hope this research will help to bring mental and physical treatments closer together which I believe can only be a step in the right direction.
Thank you for your time, Elvis

Exercise,"Hi guys, I started working out and changing my diet 3 months ago, I am working with a personal trainer but I feel like I need external validation to his methods and I’m afraid I’m not going to achieve any results.

My height is 1.83m (6”0), I started at around 90kg (198lbs) and I’m now 84.4kg (186lbs), I currently don’t see any change in my appearance since I started with him except with this numbers, we did try to check body fat percentage but he claims they are inaccurate some of the times and that we shouldn’t focus on them.

We meet at a local park for our workout and not at a gym, where he brings some equipment (t-Rex strap, an 8kg weight and mattress for some exercises).

My diet is compromised with the same meals every day in order to make it simple for me, I log them into the “MyFitnessPal” app and at the end of the day I send him a screenshot of the daily summary.

My diet

Morning:
- Salad (cucumber &amp; gamba)
- Egg
- Cottage (5% / 3%)
- Protein drink

Afternoon
- About 2 chicken breasts
- Couscous
- Kebab

Evening
- Sandwich (whole wheat bread &amp; yellow cheese)
- Tuna

This sums up to about 1800-2000 calories a day with amounts of protein 2 times my weight (170) as my trainer advised me to.

Now, because I don’t see any changes in my appearance, I’m afraid his methods aren’t working, so I would really like to hear others opinion on the matter.

Do you think the diet is ok?
Do you think (from the little I described) that I should already see changes in my appearance?
Do you think this types of workout (outdoor and not in a gym) is a good way to get fit?

Exercise,"Hello, I hope this is the right sub to ask this? When I was 15-18 I pushed myself way too hard. I spent 20 hours a week on average weight lifting, running, swimming, dancing ballet, and playing a variety of sports with a group of other homeschooled people. Around 19 I stopped completely, because life and major depression got in the way. At 22 I gained over 100lbs in two years because of a medical issue that has sense been resolved, but the weight is still there at 27. Because I pushed myself so hard when I was younger, I now have nerve/muscle damage in my shoulders that doesn't allow me to raise my arms for very long or they get tingling/pain/numb fingers, and I have bursitis in my hips. You're not really supposed to get bursitis so young, my orthopedic said that this is most likley from jogging too much too often.

It's not working well, and I can feel myself getting weaker and less flexible too so I want to be exercising. I would love to swim again but the closest pool takes an hour to drive to.

I swim at a reasonable clip but if doing 2 km it usually takes me about 45 - 50 minutes. I usually tack on about 15 extra minutes of treading water in the middle of the lake.

Exercise,"I recently got a treadmill for personal home use. It has a tablet stand that hangs a little below the main screen system, and a Bluetooth connection to sync with an app on the device. It also has one of those magnet clips that shuts off the treadmill if the magnet is disconnected to clip to your clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

The stand isn't very low though, or maybe my tablet is just tall, but if I were to use it, the top of the tablet would be resting directly on the magnet. I was trying to find out how risky that is for the tablet -- I see some sources saying stuff like weak magnets like the ones on your refrigerator aren't a risk to electronic devices, but the treadmill magnet seems stronger than that. How could I tell if the magnet poses a risk to my tablet? 

&amp;#x200B;

(I'm planning on putting an end table next to the treadmill to hold a pitcher of water, so I could put the tablet on that table instead of on the stand provided by the treadmill, but it's more convenient for the app to be right in front of me if I can put it there.)",Treadmill magnet above tablet stand -- dangerous for tablet?,1595456391

Exercise,"Please be kind because I’m really proud of myself☺️

I’m on the really heavy side of life-a combination of 44G (UK) boobs that I struggle to find a decent sports bra for, a knee injury from playing football at 15, and a pretty bad smoking habit.... Pre-knee-injury I’d walk to and from school 1.5 miles each way, do a 12 mile run every other day, weight train on alternate days to running, as well as football training 4-6pm Wednesday and Thursday, with matches on Tuesdays and Sundays. 

When I damaged my knee, my doctor refused to refer me for tests, saying it was just a sprain (18 years later I still have a heavy limp, can’t do stairs without pulling myself up, or go down stairs without my knee giving way- now written off by doctors as due to my size) meaning I had to pretty much give up all my training overnight... I did not, however, stop any of the rather large calorie intake until about 4/5 years later. Aside from a halfhearted attempt at going to the gym once a week a few years ago, not much has been going exercise wise for me lately... As a result I am huge. 5’8 and 25stone. I don’t have a problem being huge, but I also wouldn’t have a problem being smaller or at least a little bit fitter. 

So... My friend lost her mum last year, and decided during lockdown to start running a couch to 5k in the hopes of doing a charity ‘marathon in a month’ kind of thing in her memory. I’ve been watching her progress over the past few weeks and she’s done great, and raised double what she wanted to raise. She told me she didn’t think she could do it, as she has worse fitness levels than me (I walk 2 miles to work everyday whereas she drives everywhere) so I’ve been telling her how proud of her I am every opportunity I get. 

What she doesn’t realise is that she’s been inspiring me to do something a bit more exercise wise. I’ve been walking to a shop further away than my local, getting off my bus home a stop early, walking round the local streets listening to ZombiesRun! on my lunch break, little things like that.... 

But TONIGHT!!! I got home from work after a crappy 13hour shift, and saw her latest update. 24.5 miles. She’s now aiming for 40 miles by the end of the month!! I am so fantastically proud of her I’m beaming at my phone. I realise that if she can do something as amazing as that, I can push myself a little bit harder too! 

I pull out my trainers, dust off my not-very-used gym knee brace, pull on my chest binder (literally the only thing that stops me getting black eyes when doing anything more than a slow walk) and drag out my brothers ex’s copy of the Insanity workout from behind all my other DVDs. 

Instant regret! I’m sweating from pulling on my binder for goodness sake, what am I doing attempting the fit test of the Insanity workout?!? Then I realise that actually, I’m doing ok. I haven’t missed any of the exercises, and ok they aren’t perfect due to my size (seriously, they need to do a fat person version because those skinny gits obviously don’t need to be doing this!! I don’t see them trying to do Spider-Man’s or jumping jacks with a massive belly in the way!!) but I’m managing to do at least one or two of each one, with the exception of the burpees-I don’t think my knee would like me tomorrow if I attempted them, and I have a 10 hour shift lol. Every time I start slowing down, I think of my friend and how she’s doing.... Couch. 5K. 5miles. 10miles. How proud of her I am at every milestone. How proud of me she would be knowing I’m at least trying. It spurs me on to try and finish the fit test. 

I managed to do over half an hour of intense exercise. I’m sweating, wheezing, red in the face, I’m aching from muscles I’d forgotten I had, and coughing up half a lung from the 15 a day habit. I did every single exercise to the best of my ability. I had to stop a few times because I pushed myself too hard, but I got through it. 

There’s not going to be a happy ever after with this story. It’s not that kind of story. But I’ve spent at least 10 years thinking I can’t push myself to lose a bit of weight, or get a bit fitter; restricting myself because I don’t have a gym buddy, can’t afford the gym, too far from the outdoor gym, my knee won’t hold up, and all the other rubbish excuses I’ve made over the years. 

I’m not promising anyone, especially myself, that I’ll do the whole Insanity programme; but maybe I’ll do the fit test every couple of days. Maybe I’ll end up doing it every night. All I know is, despite currently wheezing from smoking too much, and the random muscle spasms from under-used muscles, I feel great. I feel like for the first time in a long time I feel like I can take control of my own fitness. And I owe it all to my friend who wanted to raise a little money for charity. ☺️",First exercise in 10 years!!,1595373611

Exercise,"How long did it take for you to lose weight after stopping lexapro?

On 5 mg lexapro = increase in appetite and didn’t feel satiated after eating for example 1/2 cup of oatmeal. Ate 1 cup instead. Noticed that my intake of calories increased. Never felt full after usual meal. Within 2 years, I gained 20+ lbs. I was an athletic body type. Now, I have extra fat. I feel self-conscious. My panic attacks and anxiety have gone down for months now. I am completely off the medicine as of Tuesday. Since March, I have started eating a plant-based diet and exercising 7 times a week because I weighed 124 lbs. before lexapro, I ate a plant-based diet and worked out 5 times a week doing the same cardio (HIIT and run). I easily shed 5 lbs of being 110 lbs in 1 month. 124 is the ever highest weight in my life. Before lexapro = 110 lbs at max. Exercise regimen since March: 3 days = run for 30 min with max heart rate at 180 BPM. 2 days = HIIT workout for 40 min with max heart rate at 140-180 BPM. 1 day of 1.5 hour walk or long hike. 1 day of 15 mil bike ride avg heart rate is 130-140; highest is 185 BPM going uphill. All I have done is gain weight. Body fat % stayed the same. Pants fit the same. In fact, I have to throw out a lot of my pants because they don’t fit anymore since March. So, 2 months ago I have been slowly tapering off lexapro. In the last week at 0.50 mg, I noticed after eating 1/2 cup oatmeal, I feel very satisfied. Not sure if it’s the side effect or my normal appetite is coming back. Help! Testimonials on losing that strange excess fat!!",Help! Losing weight after lexapro?,1595090647

I personally like to look lean and I generally feel more athletic and healthy when I impose steady state 4-5 times per week for 30 mins - 1 hour long each session.

Exercise,"I've been working on my health for a couple of months now. I quit smoking, quit drinking, started counting calories, focusing on what's going into my body. Every afternoon I go for a bike ride where 80% my heart rate is in the cardio zone. Every morning I get up at 5am and take the dogs for a brisk walk, and intermittently during that walk I'll break into a jog. All my numbers are going in the right direction, I found calf muscles and biceps, I'm feeling so much better in myself.

But I got cocky.

Yesterday I took one dog for a walk and broke into a jog. I was surprised by how easy it was, and the dog slowed down before I did. So when I got home, I was bragging to my husband about how much I'd improved and that the dogs were holding me back, perhaps I should try going for an actual run without the dog, I reckon I'd be able to handle it, no worries!

Spoiler alert: I could not handle it.

I set off today, started at a brisk walk to warm up, then when I crossed the highway I started jogging. I was determined to jog for a solid 10 minutes, how hard could it be? 

60 seconds in and I'm gasping like an asthmatic giraffe that needs to sneeze. 3 minutes in and I have to pause to vomit. The next 3 minutes I have so much saliva flooding my mouth and due to the aforementioned gasping, every time I try and breathe in, I'm choking on my own spit. I interchange 30 seconds of jogging with 30 seconds of brisk walking.

There's sweat pouring off me and I can feel my face is redder than it has any right to be.

At the 10 minute mark I turn and powerwalk home. My husband starts laughing as soon as I make it inside. I collapse face first on the floor rug and decide, nope, definitely not there yet!

Anyone have any reassurance--or any tips?",I got cocky,1595061882

I’m pretty muscular and have farm boy strength so I’m a lot stronger than I seem and I have SUPER naturally muscular legs.

Exercise,"I’m 28F and relatively slim. 5ft and 120ibs. I’m don’t really have any fat on my body just loose muscle that needs toning. (Except for my belly) 

I had a baby about 4 years ago to be honest afterwards my due to breastfeeding and hardly eating at all (new mum life mixed with ppd) my tummy was actually the flattest it’s ever been. 

Since then my diet has been awful. Lots of wine, cookies and coffee for breakfast kind of thing.

Iv now noticed that my belly is quite chunky, chunkier then Iv ever seen before, a lot on my love handles which Iv never had before. Any fat that Iv gained is solely conterntrated there! Iv also noticed Iv completely lost the shape of me waist. 

The past month Iv drastically changed.
Reduced my sugar down to practically little to no added sugar. No alcahol. Iv been working out a few times a week, 30 mins of low impact high intense cardio and then toning exercises as well as some stomach vacuums. 
Iv noticed a slight definition happening in my stomach ... mainly my upper abdomen where there is little fat. 

Before I go on trying to lose this weight and further to tone the rest of my body i would love some tips.
